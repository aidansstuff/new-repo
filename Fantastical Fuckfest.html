  <p>Charlie was twenty seven years old, lived with alone in a forest and was a virgin.</p><p>Now, if he was in a city, he would be much less than a virgin, a slut as some would call him. Yet, he chose a more humble life in the forested part of Hell, a short three hour drive from the outskirts of the closest city.</p><p>Often times he would wish he had someone in his life to be at his side as he scrounged about the forest, having to learn many skills just like that to survive.</p><p>He hated that she would end up with protein deficiencies if he didn't eat meat, but at the same time, archery was something he enjoyed to an extent. He found herself to be more skilled when it came to things like foraging and gardening, although he did enjoy cooking meals on her woodstove.</p><p>Which brings us to where we are now.</p><p>The scent of freshly baked cookies and and weed wafted through his cabin, he found herself baking a batch of cookies for Angel Dust as she had requested. He wasn't sure why he had decided to make these weed cookies for Angel Dust, but he supposed it was better than giving her homemade crack cocaine.</p><p>Chocolate chip, oatmeal and blueberry was the flavor he had chosen for Angel Dust, he was sure she would like that mix of flavors. He set up a small basket for the cookies while they cooled from being pulled from over the charcoal. A checkered towel and glass bottle of fresh goat milk where placed in the basket before he piled on the cookies as well.</p><p>He left the cookies on the stool beside the door as he reached for his hood, sure a light weight jacket with his red hood would be enough for the evening cold of autumn. Tying his blonde hair into a loose ponytail he gripped the handle of the small wooden basket and started on his walk to the gas station just out of city limits where Angel Dust often times worked.</p><p>Now, you see here folks, Charlie was no fool.</p><p>He knew this forest better than himself, he knew where to go in case of a bear chase and the shortest routes.</p><p>He also knew a deer often times followed him across the forest, a doe to be precise, white spots contrasting brown fur.</p><p>But, Charlie never actually knew if this doe was a doe.</p><p>It had a small rack, only two point, and the fur was miscoloured in the low light. Charlie found it odd, but she was a lovely doe whenever she dared step close enough to be touched.</p><p>Today, that doe decided to be bold.</p><p>She rushed Charlie, throwing him to the ground swiftly with a single ram, basket left untouched. Charlie brushed it off and stood back up, his shoulder aching, the doe tried to ram him again, he countered with a sweep that had the doe down on the ground. The doe stood back up and lowered its muzzle before rushing again, lodging its antlers into Charlies back, tearing cloth, skin and muscle, blood spilled out.</p><p>"Only the bucks are this rowdy, little doe." Charlie coughed with a weak chuckle.</p><p>Charlie dropped to the ground, intense pain forcing him into staying down on his stomach. He heard crunching of leaves as the doe circled around his form, coming to a halt in front of Charlie before standing on its hind legs.</p><p>Charlie couldn't see much in his current position, but he could see the doe anthropomorphize. Hind legs turning to ones much more human, yet still with cloven hooves and burnt red fur. The doe crouched down slowly, dressed in nothing more than few burnt leaves and twigs. Gripping Charlies ponytail, she lifted him off the ground slowly, attempting to help her despite still being wobbly on hind legs.</p><p>Charlies eyes were glued shut, afraid of what he would find if he opened them.</p><p>"Well dearie, I do think it is time for you to wake up." A static yet soft voice said, a hypnotic lull to the tone that coaxed Charlie into opening his eyes.</p><p>Charlie was greeted with some twisted type of weredoe, or, was it a buck? He couldn't quite tell as he forced eye contact, only drifting to the somewhat slim bust that signified it was indeed a weredoe. He was feeling a bit hot under the collar, greeted with a some sort of fae creation in the woods after being fumed by weed while he was baking.</p><p>He had to be tripping on his own balls.</p><p>"There you are dear, oh how I've waited so long to finally have you all to myself," The weredoe said with a crooked grin that seemed out of place, yet commented her red and black hair, speckled with bits white. "And as you said earlier, it is mating season, and I do like them a bit submissive and breedable with a kick of spice, if you know what I'm saying?"</p><p>"Uh, sure, sure thing hallucination lady," Charlie said, nodding almost obediently before gently placing down the basket of cookies and milk for Angel Dust. "We just can't break or eat the cookies inside of the basket."</p><p>"Oh, I fully understand dear, I've been watching you for so long, it only makes sense I would know you and Angel Dust have been meeting up from time to time." The weredoe said, giving a suggestive smirk, forcing Charlie to blush.</p><p>"Yeah, one could put it that way I guess," Charlie said, rolling his eyes a bit at the way the weredoe worded it, the blood dripping from the four puncture wounds on his back drying up and causing chills to run down his spine. "How do you want to go about this?"</p><p>"Oh you know dear, you just, give a bit of a fight, but I would adore if I could have near total domination over you," The weredoe said, raising her hands, thin red fur coating them both with ivory nails and speckles mixed with her fur, much like freckles. "But by the end I do require to be thoroughly bred, matings a bitch and all that jazz."</p><p>"Right, then," Charlie started, unsure of what he was getting himself into, fucking a creature of the forest that was mostly likely a hallucination that wanted to be knocked the fuck up, yeah, maybe this would be ok. "I suppose we should begin then."</p><p>The weredoe gave a smirk before throwing Charlie to the mossy ground below, a root getting caught in Charlies hair. The weredoe watched in twisted satisfaction as Charlie stood back up, dusting himself off before charging at the weredoe who countered by meeting both hands and pushing back. Hooves and boots dug into dirt as they tried to throw each other to the ground for satisfaction, the only problem was that Charlie was distracted at the scent the weredoe gave off and the slick that ran down fur from where a flimsy leaf skirt was.</p><p>Charlie let himself be thrown to the ground, the weredoe following and shedding the leaf skirt and attempting to tear off Charlies cargo shorts. He gave a mid power kick to the weredoes gut for a slight deterrence before quickly unbuttoning his shorts while the weredoe wasn't looking, doing the same with his jacket, only having worn a tank top underneath.</p><p>The weredoe came back with pressing both her knees on Charlies ribcage, knocking the wind out of him as she finished removing his shorts, finding less than she had hoped for, but, Charlie wasn't an animal, so human endowments had to expected. The weredoe was quick to shift positions, soft and short fur sending shivers of pleasure through Charlies form whenever it brushed against his more sensitive spots. Charlie would've melted right then and their as his hallucination like weredoe lowered herself onto his cock, silk like tightness enveloping his length, hell on earth.</p><p>A languid moan poured from between Charlies lips when the weredoe shifted around a bit before yanking Charlie into a sudden kiss. The weredoes tongue was similar to licking sandpaper, but much more sensual and delicious, she somehow tasted of both blood and huckleberries. Charlie fell back the second he was released, a surge of pain coursing through his skull as he hit the ground, at that same moment the weredoe dropped herself back down on his pelvis.</p><p>Fur against skin soon became humid in a sort of sense as the weredoe sped up, craving to be filled and bred more than anything as she 'violated' Charlies virgin body.</p><p>Each drop from the weredoe was like a hit of crack to Charlie, as his body had never felt much in the way of sexual pleasure before. He was shocked that he hadn't hit his orgasm yet now that he put some thought into it. He was on the edge of passing out as the weredoes drops turned into slams that threatened to crack his pelvis.</p><p>"Just cum already!" The weredoe snapped, that static voice with that hypnotic undertone making the pieces in Charlies head click.</p><p>All at once, he orgasmed. Everything exploded at once, a scream of ecstasy tore through his form as he went limp. His mind just, blanked out with the glorious feeling that settled as fur rested against his pale skin.</p><p>Charlie found that once he came down from his high the weredoe was still there and that everything had really happened, he started to panic and freak.</p><p>"Uh, that really happened?" Charlie asked as the weredoe shifted off Charlie and shook down her fur, white sliding down her burnt red fur.</p><p>"Why of course my dear, and due to the time I preyed on you, we are mated until the day we die." The weredoe said with a sadistic smirk as she prepped herself to trot off and turn back.</p><p>"Wait," Charlie said, the weredoe stopped and turned back to her prey as he scrambled to put on his shorts again. "Do, do you have a name that I could call you with?"</p><p>"Of course dear, Alastor is my name." Alastor said before prancing away leaving Charlie with a basket of cookies, milk and a head of confusion and post nut bliss.</p><p>---</p><p>Charlie stumbled into the gas station Angel Dust worked at, the latter perking up before trotting over to give a playful hug.</p><p>"I see you brought the goods." Angel Dust said with a smirk as she reached for a cookie, nibbling on the delectable morsel.</p><p>"I mated a weredoe in what I assumed was a hallucination and lost my virginity." Charlie dropped, Angel Dust froze, dropping her cookie, realizing what that meant.</p><p>"Does that mean we have to stop sleeping together?" Angel Dust asked worriedly.</p><p>"Yes, yes it does." Charlie answered with.</p>

  <p>Pulling out was a term Finn hadn't utilized in years, having become a professional breeder known throughout the multiverse.</p><p>Now, he didn't use any fancy tactics to breed his 'broodmares' for lack of better terms. He only knew that honest hard work would keep them pumped up real good when he wasn't in the area.</p><p>He was a bragger at times, but he would never tell anyone of his collection in the treehouse. He had the treehouse to himself now that Jake permanently moved in with Lady Rainicorn, a blessing and a curse.</p><p>Before we hop right on into this story, I suppose I should start from the beginning of where Finn discovered his odd talent.</p><p>It all began when Ferns first pollinating lust came around, for lack of better, anatomically correct terms, I shall use pollination and pollinating instead of heat and ruts.</p><p>Ferns first pollinating lust was something that came as just happening to him and he could not attract a singular mate. His body was producing literal mushrooms that were scattered across his form, the growth caused by the male genus bestowed by a plant body. Those mushrooms gave off a pheromone to attract females, although it was weaker on non plant females and couldn't even be smelt by males.</p><p>Given his human properties and form, he was gifted a lust for human styles of propagation that he had a hard time finding a way to deal with. Isolation and sitting it out was the only way he could finish off his cycle, attempting to rub off his plant pollen knowing it would help finish it off faster even without fulfilling human needs.</p><p>Of course, after his third year of having a real body outside of Finn Sword his parallel set of genus that made him, by definition 'male' decided to kick in.</p><p>The trickle of signs his body was changing started slow as his first full pollination state came over him.</p><p>The flowers in his hair became more colorful, the green of his body became richer and he started to smell to Finn who was eighteen at the time.</p><p>Fern woke that night, his entire body humid and tangled. His first guess was that he was just sweating balls, but as he ran a hand through his hair he realized his flowers dripped nectar and that mushrooms were mixed in as well. Panic set in as he went to stand up and rush to the roof, a rush of pheromones being released with every shifting movement.</p><p>The female part of him was begging for anyone to ruin him beyond recognition, while the male part was pleading with him to be the destroyer of virgins.</p><p>He nearly made it out before succumbing to his needs when Finn awoke due to creaky floorboards, automatically lulled in and riled up by the pheromones.</p><p>Despite what the two had agreed on, desperate times called for desperate measures.</p><p>They fucked that night, Finn surely having bred Fern, although it didn't work the same way for humans, more like mexican hat plants.</p><p>Since then, Finn has found that both Ferns nectar and pollen work as surefire aphrodisiacs, having begun to sell them to people that need a boost.</p><p>His reputation of being the holder of the strongest aphrodisiacs has spread across the known multiverse, in fact, he's begun to go to the night markets at The Boiling Isles with items to sell.</p><p>The Boiling Isles night markets were special in comparison to others universes night markets. These night markets had wares from every corner of the multiverse, each booth and stray seller had rare items unique to their world. Most booths held more naive and pure items in comparison to others booths and stray sellers that this night market allowed the propagation of.</p><p>Finn has even set up a small booth with varying aphrodisiacs from those who have been bartered off in turn for his finest wares, which is really just Ferns cum, but its pollen, so he can call it sex pollen and be biologically accurate.</p><p>Over the three years he's had in the sexy side of The Boiling Isles yearly night markets he's accrued what could be a harem in the right light, but he prefers the term broodmares, despite none of them being mares.</p><p>Except for Rainbow Dash who was feisty at first.</p><p>He has only acquired five people from trades, a gem named Lapis Lazuli, a hellhound named Loona, a Pegasus named Rainbow Dash, an alien who went by Starfire and a half ghost named Dani.</p><p>All five of them had become subsequent joiners of Ferns lifestyle under Finns care as a breeding machine.</p><p>For safety reasons they weren't allowed to leave the treehouse, except for Fern, who was allowed to leave on adventures. They were allowed to roam the treehouse all they wanted when they weren't being bred again, most of which being able to be knocked up mid pregnancy. They were kept in good care despite the living conditions they now had, all of them agreed on that.</p><p>But for Finn, the best part was what he could rack up cash wise with the sex inducing byproducts they created during, after or before their version of heat or pregnancy.</p><p>Tonight just so happened to the last night the night market was facilitated until next year, and because of that Finns business had slowed down, but not after hundreds of dollars of profit. He was nearly half asleep when a girl with a strikingly similar guy with a leash on walked up to him, the slammed down a fiver and twenty five cents waking Finn up fully.</p><p>"Hello, what can I get for your parents, kid?" Finn asked, unable to help but crack a smart one at how young the girl looked for a what he hoped was eighteen years old.</p><p>"Nice one wise guy, I just want an aphrodisiac, everyone else sent me to you, and I know you're probably fresh out, and that this isn't enough to pay, but I can promise you more," The girl said tone desperate. "And my name is Mabel if we ever meet again."</p><p>"You want Hellhound Musk, Gem Pow or my best seller, literal Sex Pollen, also comes in nectar variety." Finn offered, placing down a small jar of each, each jar fancy in its own way and glass colored differently.</p><p>"Do any of them work on lesbians?" Mabel asked, Finn simply pulled up a different jar.</p><p>"Marcy said they all worked great on PB, but Rainbow Gush worked best for her," Finn said before grabbing a small dropper and cracking open the jar, dripping a few drops into a small bag. "Five twenty five is only enough for a single nights worth though."</p><p>"That's a let down, but, it'll have to do." Mabel said before reaching for the jar, Finn pulled it out of her reach.</p><p>"Unless you have something to trade for a full jar and a bit of Hellhound Musk," Finn said, raising a brow at the guy who shuddered a bit despite knowing this was coming. "I will need some convincing though."</p><p>"This is my brother Dipper, he's a good boy, uh, a little insecure and paranoid, very familiar with the paranormal, heard he's acceptable in the sheets from Tyrone," Mabel explained, Finn gestured for the girl to go on, needing to hear one crucial stat on the boy before agreeing, the selling point for his girls was that they were fertile. "I know for a fact he's fertile due to the bit of dream demon he absorbed, or some shit like that."</p><p>"Could this 'dream demon' be half awoken for purposes you don't need to know?" Finn asked as he reached for the jars he had promised, willing to trade even if the guys dream demon bits couldn't be awoken.</p><p>"Not to my knowledge," Mabel said as the jars were on the table, she put the end of Dippers leash on the table as well, the guy was shaking in his boots, the collar on his neck black and spiked. "Do we have a deal?"</p><p>"Yes we do, feel free to come over to my universe if you care to check in on your brother, I he's in good hands, Mabel." Finn said before Mabel walked off, leaving Dipper on the verge of a panic attack with his leash in Finns possession, he could easily break out of this collar and make a run for it, bunk with Amity until he felt safe enough, but a deal was a deal, that he knew tried and true.</p><p>Finn was unsure if Mabel was pulling his leg on the fertile part, but the guy did seem obedient enough, even with his expression blocked by his hat. Finn gently gripped the collar before pressing a button the stand, having it shrink down to the size of a briefcase, even with the wares left inside. Finn led Dipper across the night market, the sight of one with a leashed being common enough for no one to freak.</p><p>Dipper seemed apprehensive on walking through the portal that led to a field a short walk to the treehouse he would soon be quarantined to, but he followed reluctantly when he was nudged. After the portal had closed, the two stopped as a gust of fresh, cooling air hit them, stars above bright compared to the torches of the night market. With a sigh Finn dropped the leash and undid Dippers collar, the latter shocked greatly, but still following closely having heard of Finns more violent feats as well.</p><p>"So, you have a bit of dream demon, right?" Finn asked as he pulled off his suit jacket and wrapped it around his face, revealing his fully robotic arm and iconic blue shirt.</p><p>"Yeah, his name was Bill Cipher, forgot to seal the deal as over before he died, so, a part of him is permanently asleep inside of me, slowly being woken up every time I dream," Dipper explained with a bit of a sigh. "No one knows what's gonna happen when he wakes up, or what managed to survive wakes up, all I know is that my body will be at his disposal until they end up killing him, by destroying my body."</p><p>"Yikes, sounds rough," Was all that Finn had to say as they came up to the first door of the treehouse. "Now, uh, what you may or may not see on the second floor may fuck you up a bit, but I need you to know that their is reason behind what I do and that they all, they all are ok with this now, but it might take some time for you to get used to it ok?"</p><p>"I know," Dipper started as he closed the door before heading to the staircase, following Finn closely. "I'm more worried about the whole, being bred thing, doesn't help the dream demon lets me be knocked up at near anytime."</p><p>"Look, I never wanted to be traded people for my wares, but one thing leads to another and now I have five 'sluts' who are actually really nice people, all producing an aphrodisiac that I can sell, sometimes for more people," Finn explained before helping Dipper through the hatch, being greeted with the scent of fresh meatloaf. "A cruel cycle only rewarded by meatloaf."</p><p>"So, I'm assuming that after you eat your meal, I'm gonna be thrown in the basement after being pumped full of your semen till I pop out a child that'll get sold off or something like that?" Dipper asked before being offered a seat at the table, tray of meatloaf on the stove.</p><p>"How cruel do you think I am, I have a soul, Dipper," Finn said as he pulled down seven plates and eight cups, plating the meatloaf with half a carrot on each plate, filling half the cups with water and three with dragon fruit juice. "Milk, water or dragon fruit juice?"</p><p>"Water please." Dipper said, unsure of if this hospitality was a ruse or genuine.</p><p>"Soups on!" Finn shouted as he laid down each plate on the table, setting up a few chairs as well, a sets of footsteps closing in on the two, some heavier than others.</p><p>Down trotted a group of five females, each strikingly different in appearance, slim despite being for breeding and in high spirits.</p><p>The hellhound sat next to Dipper who was in the middle of the curved couch with the seemingly ghostly one next to him as well, the Pegasus 'sitting' on the edge with Finn, the gem and the alien sitting on the chairs.</p><p>"Before we really indulge, except for you Loona, I can see your starving," Finn said, the hellhound, Loona, gave a quick thanks before starting to eat. "I would like to introduce you to Dipper, who got traded for a jar of Rainbow Gush and Hellhound Musk."</p><p>"You think a guys worth that much?" The ghostly one scoffed.</p><p>"Not like he has any use to you." Loona added on.</p><p>"Oh yeah, his sister said he's fertile, and has dream demon in him, a double win." Finn said, a bit of shock was shared as all eyes landed on Dipper who was starting to feel overwhelmed at all the attention and tried to distract himself by slowly eating his food.</p><p>"Ah, so he's never been taken before then?" The alien asked.</p><p>"Indeed Starfire, so, he definitely doesn't want to be here assuming everything is going to be dogshit," Finn explained, everyone gave a murmur of agreement. "So, instead of setting him up right away to be bred I was thinking, one of you could give him a show of the ropes in your own special way, if you want to of course."</p><p>Dipper was confused at how cautious Finn was with these girls, they all should be perfectly submissive and willing roll over and do just about anything for their breeder according to his research. What Dipper didn't know was that half of the women in this room could kill both Finn and Dipper in a snap if they wanted, how they stayed calm enough to be fucked and have aphrodisiacs harvested from them was quite a shock.</p><p>"I could," The green one asked quietly. "It's almost time for me again anyways, flowers starting to produce nectar."</p><p>"Fern, no, you already work yourself thin around the house, you don't have to," Finn said, Fern nodded before taking a sip of his juice, Dipper taking note of the fact that Fern appeared to be male, yet still lived in this twisted funhouse. "Would anyone else be willing to?"</p><p>"I can prep him a bit with some of Ferns Nectar, but I'm not willing to do more than that." Loona offered as Dipper finished his plate of meatloaf, taken aback at the thought of a hellhound prepping him, but it didn't sound detestable.</p><p>"Perfect, you can use the couch." Finn said before Loona stood up, Dipper following her closely until they reached the couch.</p><p>Loona vaguely gestured for Dipper to strip down as she reached for a jar of Nectar, Dipper doing as gestured, reluctant to remove his cap which Loona didn't seem to mind, nor did she care. She gestured for Dipper to turn and present himself in a fashion similar to animals, ass raised and forearms on the couch for support with legs spread a bit as well for ease of access.</p><p>Loona popped the cap on the small jar before dousing two of her fingers in the stuff, an intense aroma swamping her senses as it wafted through the treehouse, affecting Dipper to. He shuddered when a dry claw ran down the cleft oh his ass cheeks and threatened to dip to a different region before being pulled back, a damp and furry digit was pressed to his hole. The liquid caused what could be a numbing sensation till it caused his muscles to ease, Loona slowly pushing deeper, waiting for each millimeter to ease able to tell Dipper was a virgin given how much resistance he showed despite how strong the aphrodisiac was.</p><p>The scent and permeation of his insides was having an effect on Dipper, allowing him to become a bit more open to whatever was coming to him, mentally and physically. His forearms were already getting a bit sore, so he let them fall out from underneath him, Loonas claw tearing him a bit, only a light sting on Dippers end despite blood spilling. Silently was how Loona doused her second finger, able to slide it in with ease given how powerful the aphrodisiac on the virgin below her, even the slicked down fur didn't seem to be noticed by Dipper as she pumped her two fingers.</p><p>When she was sure Dipper was ready she flipped him onto the couch, belly up, he looked to be hammered despite just being hopped up on nectar, the sweet scent fogging his mind. Only at this time did Loona notice that Dipper had female assets, to that she gave a smirk before dousing a fresh finger on her other hand, spreading Dippers leg with her hind leg easily. Crouching down to be at close to eye level with Dipper she ran a claw up his dripping cunt, he withheld a moan that only spurred her on as she worked the aphrodisiac into the tissue of his sensitive regions.</p><p>She slipped her claw in deeper, tearing something that elicited a short yelp from Dipper, fresh blood from the tear spilling onto the fabric of the couch. Loonas ears flattened to her head before she slowly worked the aphrodisiac further into Dipper, hoping he would forgive her for tearing him a bit, she slowly slid in a second fuzzy, slicked down digit. Dipper jerked his hips experimentally, gaining a shot of pleasure, Loona pulled out knowing he was ready, Dipper whimpered in disappointment, mood flickering when he saw Finn walk in.</p><p>"I hope you're ready, cause believe me, I sure am."</p>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>Princess Sally Acorn and Sonic The Hedgehog were going on a date at the hottest bar in Mobius, and Sonic was hyped.</p><p>The night had been planned in advance for two weeks, each day like a year for Sonic who simply couldn't wait to go out for a night with his not yet determined mate.</p><p>It was only a big event for the azure blur because he was the last in his family without a partner, let alone a mate. Both of his siblings had gotten with someone already, Sonia had gotten someone first, it happened to be Bunnie after Antoine was roboticized a year prior, the twos wedding planned in to be three months. Oddly enough Manic had settled down for the time with someone as well, he never thought himself to be one for dating, yet him and Silver were still fucking like rabbits after a month of being together.</p><p>Leaving Sonic to be the only one who didn't have a partner, once he had solidified his relationship with Sally, then he would be equal to Manic on that level. Even if Sally let him down somewhat softly he could settle for Mina or maybe even Amy, but he really hoped he wouldn't have to do that.</p><p>The three siblings still lived in their bus, well, only two of them now that Sonia moved out, but it was still a full house in terms of space. Due to Manic living in the same place as Sonic, he got to hear all about what was happening, somewhat jealous of how hard it was to get in. But even through jealousy, he was still happy for his brother and even managed to get a way in through Sonic convincing Sally to allow him a plus one. Manic and Sonic had come to mutual agreement that Manic would not interfere in any way that mattered, only air hockey, stick hockey and a few drinks.</p><p>In a similar stance to school girls hyped for their first school dance, the two prepared themselves for the Sonics big night.</p><p>"Bro," Manic started as he slicked back his lime quills a bit, throwing finger guns at his reflection with a smirk. "We lookin' fly as fuck."</p><p>"I don't know Manic," Sonic started as he double checked his outfit, undoubtedly loving the whole leather accessories style, but unsure it fit his personality. "I'm not sure leather compliments my blue quills."</p><p>"I would never set you wrong bro, just hold still while I grab the dye and eye liner." Manic said before dashing to his drawers, Sonic taking a seat on the ground as he waited for Manic to return with all the items he needed to finish Sonics look.</p><p>"Ok, don't open your eyes." Manic said after having Sonic close his eyes, a wet brush being placed against his eyelid, the sensation alien to Sonic who held still as the eyeliner was applied.</p><p>A lovely shade of deep, sparkling turquoise lined Sonics eyes, he only opened them after he was told to, and even then it still felt a bit weird. The two sat face to face before Manic held up black fur dye with a smirk, Sonic sighed before Manic sat down and handed the dye to Sonic, placing a stained towel on his shoulders. Sonic worked the dye into some of Manics quills, mostly the tips for majority of his brothers lime quills, trying to make quick work of the job, despite knowing they still had more than enough time.</p><p>"Thanks bro," Manic said after Sonic finished, the two stood up before Sonic pulled on his signature white gloves, two large wrings pulled down overtop as well instead of his usual rolled up cuff look. "Now we really looking fly."</p><p>"Sure, I just hope Sally doesn't think I look 'emo' she'll hate that." Sonic said, starting to panic a little bit about how he looked and whether or not that would affect his chances.</p><p>"Relax Sonic, I'm sure she'll love it," Manic said in a somewhat comforting tone. "Now, help me wash out the dye in my quills."</p><p>Sonic rolled his eyes before heading over to the sink with Manic and washing out his quills, leaving black markings scattered across lime, it fit Manic shockingly well.</p><p>The two rolled up in their van and confidently strode in before taking a seat at the bar where Sally had said she would be sitting.</p><p>But, there was no Sally.</p><p>Sonic still sat in his red, pleather, spinning stool, Manic beside him, unable to help but take some shots as they chatted. After a good fifteen minutes the two were only a bit tipsy, Sonic moreso than Manic, both still had a good grip on reality though as they continued to go off. After thirty more minutes the two asked the waitress for another round of shots, a piece of paper and a pencil, they took a shot for each game of Xs and Os they won.</p><p>After fifteen more minutes, Manic started to get bored and migrated over to air hockey, versing Honey and Fiona who both were clearly a few bottles in, but still putting up a great fight. Manic wandered from game to game in search of someone he could easily wash without struggle, winding up at Pong against Julie-Su who was an easy match.</p><p>Sonic still sat at that same seat, waiting impatiently for his date, a nearly untouched martini was in front of him.</p><p>Eventually, Manic had to tell him.</p><p>"Bro, she stood you up." Manic said somewhat quietly as he placed a hand on Sonics shoulder, the azure gave a sigh before hopping off his stool and grabbing his martini.</p><p>"I can see that bro," Sonic said before downing his drink and dropping in a few coins, placing the glass back on the counter, hoping the waitress would get the tip. "Could we have a round of air hockey before we go?"</p><p>"Of course we can, it'll be me and you versus Honey and Fiona though." Manic said before leading his off balance older brother to the air hockey table and setting up the game.</p><p>The two siblings played against Honey and Fiona till they decided to call it a night and left, leaving Sonic and Manic to play against each other. They both played with two bumpers with one in each hand to simulate two players, up until an ebony hedgehog sidled up to Sonic and joined in as player two for team blue.</p><p>"So," The crimson marked hedgehog started, bumping shoulders with Sonic, playing it off as an attempt to hit the puck, Manic was catching drift. "What brings you and your friend here, only royalty and the wealthy can make it in."</p><p>"I had a date, she didn't come." Sonic said, aggressively scoring, he smirked a bit.</p><p>"Oh, if you don't mind me asking, was it Sally Acorn?" The ebony hedgehog asked, Sonic froze up.</p><p>"Yeah, stood me the fuck up, only reason Manic is here is because he wanted to come along and score from free drinks," Sonic said bitterly as he shot the puck across the board, Manic countering as he listened closely to the conversation, waiting to butt in until later. "I'm Sonic by the way."</p><p>"Well, Sonic, I'm Shadow," The crimson marked hedgehog, Shadow, said carefully, before continuing his sentence, aiming to play the long game on the tipsy azure blur. "And I hate to be the one to break it to you, but I found Sally doing the nasty with Knuckles through a hotel window I was passing by." Sonic gave a low growl at that, mood dropping, but imagery popping into his head that caused twisted arousal.</p><p>"That bitch," Sonic snarled before Manic shot the winning score, ending the game, both of the siblings stretched a bit. "Ok, Shadow, if you know what hotel they're at, take me there now, so I can mutilate both her and Knuckles."</p><p>"How about instead of releasing anger one way thats a bit violent, we head on over to my place instead and have a night to ourselves, alone." Shadow offered, Sonic seemed content as he followed Shadow out before being stopped by Manic.</p><p>"Make it quick bro." Sonic snapped at his younger sibling who froze up a bit.</p><p>"Just, don't let this Shadow guy take to much from you, bye bro, come home tomorrow." Manic said before taking his separate path to the van, Sonic following Shadow to the ebony hedgehogs car, being greeted with a jet black motor cycle that had crimson markings in a similar fashion to the hedgehog.</p><p>Truly a hot ride for a hot hog to match.</p><p>---</p><p>When the two reached Shadows place they sat on the couch in silence, Sonic unsure of what to do with Shadow knowing exactly what to do.</p><p>"Now, before we begin," Shadow started, catching Sonics attention. "I am going to need you're explicit consent, and for you to know that I do release a pheromone that makes people more suggestible."</p><p>"Oh, uh, sure, I don't have anyone else to fuck, and I'm sure weird pheromones will make the experience better anyways." Sonic said before being pinned by Shadow at a medium pace.</p><p>"One last thing," Shadow said, Sonic vaguely gestured for him to continue. "Anal, blow or hand?"</p><p>"Fuck me in the ass man, I don't wanna sit here all night-!" Sonic tried to say, only to be cut off by Shadow who quickly pulled Sonic into a tight kiss, pulling up the azure before pressing a blunt claw to the rodents backdoor.</p><p>Shadow slipped in a forked tongue, Sonic shuddered at the sensation only slightly, tensing immensely as when Shadow forced in his first finger, dry and without anything to act as a lubricant. The ebony fur was rough against Sonics insides, causing a short spark of pain that quickly subsided when Shadow ruffled his own quills, a small puff of powder quickly dissipating, but the initial effects lasting as Shadow thrusted his finger slowly to loosen Sonic up.</p><p>Sonics eyes fluttered a bit as his heartbeat stuttered before he bucked his hips downwards to meet Shadows finger, Shadow smirked before releasing the kiss and slipping in a second finger that made Sonic release a small noise of shocked pleasure. Shadow spread his two furred digits a bit, Sonics body refusing to budge enough, Shadow ruffled his quills once more releasing another round of pollen like substance into the air that eased Sonic further until Shadow felt confident enough that Sonic was good and ready.</p><p>Shadow dropped Sonic onto the couch before flipping the azure over the armrest and onto his stomach, Sonic was only a little bit braindead due to the amount of pheromones he had inhaled, but he was still cognitive enough to comprehend the world around him. He gave a soft moan when he felt a set of blunt claws pressing into his back, kneading around the base of his dorsal spikes until they started to go limp, why Sonic got this treatment was beyond him.</p><p>Shadow sighed before spitting on his paws and running the damp fur across his cock, the virgin below was dazed and loose enough to take Bigs cock, so how come Shadow was still nervous. The ebony hedgehog gripped Sonics tightly before snapping his pelvis against Sonics hips, hilting himself in the moaning hedgehog in one fell swoop. Sonic nearly blacked out for a second as the ebony hedgehog had hit his prostate, nearly triggering orgasm, instead a slight body spasm as his entire body tensed up, pulling a groan from Shadow.</p><p>"Move your cock already..." Sonic stated shakily, Shadow gave a smirk before starting to piston his hips at an insane pace, nearly tearing Sonics insides, the blue hedgehog releasing languid moans that would've been heard by the neighbors if the walls weren't soundproofed.</p><p>Shadow was chasing orgasm, whereas Sonic was being chased by orgasm.</p><p>A wave of bliss overcoming them and consuming them when Shadow hit that sweet spot that caused Sonic to see stars, Shadow releasing another wave of pheromones which caused Sonics brain to go to mush again and dampen the scream of pleasure. The blinding shot of ecstasy that hit Shadow was a one shot kill and he was nearly out cold in seconds of aftershock, pulling out and gripping a spare blanket to throw over the two of them.</p><p>They fell asleep in each others arms that night, black gripping blue tightly in a way that commonly signifies protection and affection. They spent the night on that cum stained couch asleep in each others arms in the most disney style way. Dreams of grassy fields and wakes of destruction flittered about their minds as they slept that night in post nut bliss.</p><p>No matter the setting, they were at each others side in their dream.</p>

  <p>The temple was utter chaos, from the external problems they had been presented with to the sudden inner turmoil Marcy had been presented with.</p><p>All because Anne had to take off her damn coat.</p><p>Thats when it started, the rest of the mission went fine, just fine, aside from Marcys distraction she had to refrain from voicing despite wanting to so bad.</p><p>If she did voice her thoughts, she could get them killed or worse, she was so selfish for having such a feeling spark in her mind.</p><p>No, no, she wasn't being selfish, these feelings were rational for someone her age.</p><p>But for her best friend?</p><p>She would have to think about this later, she just needed to relax now, and not let languid imagery keep popping into her head to distract her from serenity.</p><p>Marcy heard the door slowly creak open, she closed her eyes and steadied her breathing hoping to feign being asleep despite knowing it would never work if it was Sasha. She heard footsteps slowly come closer before the bed slowly gave way underneath whoever was sitting beside her, she didn't move, she just tried to stay relaxed.</p><p>"Marcy, I know you're awake," Sasha said gently, Marcy gave a short sigh before cracking open her eyes and sitting up, leaning on Sasha a bit. "You wanna talk about those pleading eyes you were giving Anne over the course of the mission?"</p><p>Marcy froze up a bit with a worried chuckle, giggle would work better to describe the sound she made, high pitched.</p><p>"Mar." Sasha said sternly, voice sharp enough to leave cuts.</p><p>"I don't know Sash, she just, took off her jacket, and then something decided to wake up and go 'oh, fuck be gay' I don't know how to explain it." Marcy said with a long sigh, Sasha rolled her eyes before resting her chin in her gloved hands.</p><p>"You know how you deal with problems Mar-Mar?" Sasha asked, rethinking what she about to say after Marcy responded, unsure if planting the seeds was a good idea for Anne or Marcy, but she had seen the two exchange glances more than enough times to know the feelings where requited.</p><p>"No..." Marcy said quietly as she pulled her knees to her chest, resting her face between her kneecaps in shame, Sasha always knew how to deal with almost everything, but Marcy didn't even know how to kill of some feels for her best friend.</p><p>"Face it head on, its harder to do that with feelings, but just tell Anne how you feel and ask if you can make it past third base with her, I'm sure she'd be fine with it." Sasha said before standing up and brushing herself down, tapping her boots on the ground just to make sure she wouldn't step funny and roll her ankle due to not being aware of her own body, Marcy shot straight up when she noticed Sasha was taking her leave.</p><p>"You just want me to do the nasty with her?" Marcy asked with a bit of agitation, sure the idea sounded lovely to her still frazzled mind, but it also sounded so wrong.</p><p>"Yeah, how else are you gonna face those 'weird' feelings unless you try it out and see if," Sasha stated, pausing for a second or two to rethink her words, make sure she wouldn't allude to anything unintentionally. "See if thats just what you're meant to feel, even if people don't like it, I'll send Anne in soon."</p><p>"Wait, Sash, I can't do that-!" Marcy tried to argue, Sasha shot a silencing look that had Marcy trembling.</p><p>"Just remember that real women get consent." Sasha said before exiting the room, slowly closing the door on the way out, leaving Marcy alone with her thoughts.</p><p>Marcy knew that Sasha would act fast after planting a simple idea in someones head, having baited the hook for Marcy to indulge in her desires over Anne. She only had say, ten minutes to think of what she could do, after getting consent of course, if she didn't Sasha would have her head mounted on a wall.</p><p>Marcy saw herself ravaging Anne, bringing pure bliss to her friend through the most sensual forms of stimulation she could think of after passing the first two bases. She thought that she wouldn't need the favor to be returned for pleasure, the sight of Anne melting below her in pure pleasure would be enough. But on the same page she also wanted to be destroyed by Anne, ruined by such a glorious brunette in the serenity of the setting sun, it such a beautiful thought, she found herself getting turned on by the idea alone.</p><p>Both ideas sound glorious to Marcy, she was torn from her thoughts when she heard the door open and Anne walked in only in her school uniform, hair still a mess with leaves and twigs, a shoe still missing and an almost worried smile on her face.</p><p>Marcy gave a soft smile, Annes mood lightened near instantaneously when she saw Marcy smile softly at the sight of Anne, not paying attention to the red that coated her face. Anne slowly stepped closer to Marcy, who was unaware of what Sasha had told Anne, the blonde having said that Marcy needed to talk about something horrible she had done. What Anne didn't know is that Sasha had lied, further attracting fish to the hook, the blonde also stated that Marcy had been wishing to spend more time with Anne, giving a look that said Marcy wanted more than just gaming or chatting.</p><p>"So," Anne started as she walked closer, unsure of what Marcy wanted from her, but now noticing the crimson painting her friends face, oh nuts, she was gonna commit rape, no, Marcy didn't have it in her to commit such an act. "Sasha sent me in and said you wanted to spend some time together."</p><p>"That's what she said then," Marcy said, gently rolling her eyes before Anne sat down next to her, both with their feet on the floor. "Look, I, I've been thinking 'bout that mission to the second temple."</p><p>"What about it?" Anne asked cautiously, unsure of what Marcy would say, or what would happen, she fidgeted with the hemming of her shirt.</p><p>"Remember when you took off your jacket," Marcy said, Anne nodded slowly, only having a faint idea of where this was going. "Yeah, heh, kind of went 'oh, fuck be gay' and have been thinking about that for a while now."</p><p>"I guess, I mean, it took you long enough to figure out for yourself, glad you cleared things up now." Anne said before going to stand up, stopped by Marcy gripping her wrist, the brunette turned to look at Marcy who had to choke down her doubt before asking a simple question.</p><p>"Could we try some things out," Marcy said, Anne raised a brow, wanting to make sure this was Marcy asking for sex and not something else. "I just want to make sure that, that this how I really feel and not just a fluke for that one time."</p><p>"You know what, sure, just don't be mad if things don't go exactly as you want them to," Anne said, it was Marcys turn to raise a brow at what Anne meant. "It's just that, you know, frogs, weird new stuff here that isn't available home."</p><p>"Right, right, then, we should probably begin-" Marcy said before being abruptly pulled into a kiss, one of Annes hands pressed to Marcys back to keep her closer and from falling, the other already hiking up Marcys thigh.</p><p>The world melted around as Marcy as Anne dominated her, the alien sensation of tongue that wasn'y her own pleasurable, but, but Marcy wanted to be the one in control.</p><p>Marcy tried to push back, Anne gave the best smirk she could at what Marcy attempted before allowing Marcy to push her into the sheets. Not knowing where to go from here, Marcy followed what she knew made her feel good during those shameful nights, she started by reaching to pull off Annes shirt. Stained fabric slid off Anna easily, leaving her chest bare, flustering Marcy quite a bit, but the ravenette still pressed on in her conquest, with a bit of commentary.</p><p>"No, no bra huh?" Marcy asked somewhat shakily as she ran her hands up Annes sides, the still gloved one sending rough tingles across her skin, causing shivers of pleasure.</p><p>"It's Amphibia, you think anyone could give less of a fuck?" Anne retorted with before leading Marcys hands to her breasts, there wasn't a lot there, but what was there was extremely sensitive, Marcy took note of that as she kneaded at the flesh, drawing soft noises from Anne.</p><p>"Good point." Marcy said before lowering herself down to Anne a bit more until she was close enough to lick at Annes areola, gaining a desired reaction from Anne, the brunette tensing and silently moaning, still fully aware that other people where inside and would investigate if things got to loud, Marcy was hoping she could bring Anne enough stimulation to make Anne howl in pleasure.</p><p>While continuing to worship Annes torso and chest, she slid her hand down to slip past the waistband of Annes skirt, her fingers ice against increasingly hot skin, it caused Anne to shudder audibly. Marcy slid her hand further down Anne, sliding two fingers between Annes thigh and the outer edge of her labia, her fingers heating up rapidly given the heat Annes lower half held. Marcy slipped her fingers between Annes lower lips, causing Annes to release a forcibly quieted moan, her lower half slick enough that Marcy wouldn't need any other form of lube.</p><p>Marcy lifted her head from Annes chest to find a contorted look of pleasure on Annes face, one both knew was contorted due to having to keep quiet and repress pleasure. Annes arms were limp at her side, pleasure shaking her body, she knew she would have to repay Marcy ten fold or more after she got her sweet relief. She nearly screamed when Marcy thrust in three of her digits, biting her tongue to the point of drawing blood to silence her ruptured pleasure.</p><p>Marcy scissor and pumped her digits in and out of Anne who was releasing partially withheld groans and moans of pleasure, bucking her hips aggressively from time to time. A weak smirk grew on Annes face, one that Marcy didn't notice until she was roughly yanked down to meet Anne who sat up a bit to be met in a kiss. Passion sparked at the second kiss, feelings now known to be requited causing the sensation to be enhanced many fold, Marcy moaned into the kiss, reflexively thrusting her three digits knuckle deep into Anne.</p><p>Anne hit orgasm just like that, a blinding pleasure tearing across her entire body, she nearly screamed, Marcy quickly slapping a hand over Annes mouth to muffle the delicious sounds. Warm, white, relief slipped past and between Marcys digits, spilling onto the inner layer of Annes purple skirt. Marcy released her hand from Annes mouth, gingerly bring up her coated digits, Anne slowly sat up to be greeted with the sight of Marcy licking her fingers clean, flavor and texture shockingly delicious.</p><p>"What's the verdict?" Anne asked as she sat up and propped herself on her palms, a faint squelch could be heard when she moved, body still shook up from orgasm caused by hands not her own, but she always was quick to recover.</p><p>"Definitely not a fluke, but at the same time it was kind of bland," Marcy explained, Anne refrained from smirking as she pulled on her shirt again, knowing it would be best to wear it incase someone walked in, they would still be a crimson shade, but it would be better for her to have a shirt on. "Like a few elements for some sort of spice to the experience where left out."</p><p>"Thats where I come in," Anne said before dropping down and grabbing her bag, pulling out a smallish cardboard box that was littered in keep out messages and skulls. "I promise to repay you the pleasure ten fold."</p><p>"That, that actually sounds great, what do you want me to do?" Marcy asked as she pulled off her gloves, cape and weaponry.</p><p>"Just keep quiet and tell me if you don't like something so I don't scare you off," Anne said as she cracked open the box while Marcy shed off the rest of her clothing, what lay inside the box was a series of odd items, some of which similar despite being made for frogs as they had been bought in Amphibia. "Promise me that you'll tell me if things get out of hand for you, cause I'm satisfied and can stop when you want me to."</p><p>"Promise." Marcy said before Anne instructed her to keep her hands under the pillow her head rested on now as Anna lathered her fingers in a bioluminescent ooze seemingly glittered.</p><p>Truth be told, Anne had never used an aphrodisiac on someone else before, she had hoped Marcys pleasure receptors wouldn't override the rest of her brain like the vendor warned. The vendor she bought this from called it 'Sex Nectar' a guy named Finn sold it at The Boiling Isles during the night market and she couldn't help but buy some of the more naughty and otherworldly items she found. Anne knew that she herself took two layers of the stuff on the parts she wanted to stimulate into giving her orgasm, so she decided that Marcy would be fine with just one layer of the ooze.</p><p>Anne gingerly pressed her fingers to Marcys chest, slathering both minuscule mounds with the ooze that quickly sunk in and would take effects soon. She moved her hands to Marcys lower half next, rubbing her thumbs on the inner edges of Marcys labia, and her fingers two inches down the ravenettes inner thighs. Anne had to work the ooze in herself a little bit in this area, resulting in soft mewls of pleasure from Marcy as Anne pressed down on Marcys clit, just barely skimming the edges of her insides before lifting her hands. Anne smeared the leftover ooze on her fingers across both sides of Marcys neck, mainly at the conjunction between shoulder and neck, where a scent gland would be if this was the Omegaverse.</p><p>Marcy shuddered as the aphrodisiac started to take effect, even the slightest breeze causing waves of a tingling yet pleasurable sensation to run through her. Anne gave a slight smirk before running a hand across Marcys relatively flat chest, Marcys world melted and her expression showed it in spades. Anne pulled out two items from the box, a pair of bugs and a strip of fabric, Marcy looked perplexed at the bugs until her sight was closed off by the blindfold being tied around her head. Marcy clenched and unclenched her fists, her breathing starting to hasten with the tightness around her head and the darkness coating her vision, Anne took note.</p><p>"Hey, hey, are you ok, do you want me to take it off?" Anne asked softly, Marcy shook her head before steeling herself.</p><p>Anne took a deep breathe before rubbing the two bugs together rapidly to build a small charge and wake them up a bit, they started to vibrate almost audibly. She gently placed them on Marcys areolas, the ravenette started to stutter a bit, holding back moans the best she could given the sudden hyper intensive pleasure the vibrations gave her. If Marcy wasn't blind folded her eyes would be visibly half lidded, but her mouth still hung open a bit, the claustrophobia of being blindfolded melting as the pleasure shot that fear out of the air.</p><p>Anne took note of Marcys reaction, smiling a little bit before sliding her hands along Marcys calves, slowly working her way to Marcys thighs. Anne improperly massaged each inch of Marcys legs, sending waves of an odd pleasure to Marcys frying brain, Marcy was biting her tongue to withhold her moans, releasing a squeak when Anne pressed down gently on her inner thighs. Anne removed her fingers from Marcys burning skin, the ravenette gave a soft whine as Anne reached for a specially designed piece of polished metal, always a desirable temperature of coldness.</p><p>Anne slowly placed the metal between Marcys thighs, the ravenette responding by snapping her thighs shut like a bear trap, resulting in what would've been a high pitched moan if Anne didn't cover her mouth. Wave after wave of pleasure shot through Marcy as Anne shifted around the chilled piece of metal, the texture was smooth and pleasuring to Marcy as Anne slowly moved the metal closer to Marcys lower lips. Anne lifted the metal up, one hand still pressed to Marcys mouth, the ravenettes chest still with vibrating bugs attached, two blue beetles that had weak electric pulses building with skin contact.</p><p>"Marcy," Anne started quietly, Marcy nodded shakily, drool slipping from between her lips, pleasure shaking her. "Are you ready for your turn to be shook with pleasure."</p><p>"Yeeaasshhh, pleeshe..." Marcy slurred out shakily, bucking her hips aggressively looking for that cold relief.</p><p>Anne lowered the metal piece down beside Marcys leg before grabbing a thick log and placing it between Marcys knees to keep her legs spread, grabbing a chunk of amber and placed it between Marcys teeth to gag her and keep her quiet. Anne gently pressed her forearms against the shining blue shells of the zap beetles and slicked up the piece of cold metal before pressing it against Marcys clit, getting a muffled moan as she was pushed to the precipice of orgasm.</p><p>Anna took a steady breath before pushing down on the shells of the beetles and shoving the metal into Marcy in one swift motion.</p><p>Marcy nearly screamed as her first non masturbation orgasm tore the fuck through her in one ripping motion as her entire body tensed, sticky white gushing out as the damn broke. Her body shook until the waves of pleasure wore off, lingering static on her skin as she relaxed, Anne removing each non human made toy from her friends form. The ravenette couldn't keep her vision straight as Anne pulled a shirt over Marcys torso and helped her into a spare skirt, Marcy still shaking a bit as she steadied her breathing unable to help but rest on Anne.</p><p>"So, whats the new verdict, Marbles?" Anne asked lovingly as she leaned on the head of the bed, Marcy resting on her chest.</p><p>"Absolutely a yes, perfectly a yes, Anne." Marcy said in an almost begging voice, Anne leaned her head on Marcys shoulder, the latter shuddering as that space was still aphrodisiac sensitive.</p><p>Anne smirked before biting down hard enough to draw blood, Marcy huffed out a broken up moan in an attempt to withhold the sound.</p><p>"Good, you know, we should probably get going on our next mission, you know?" Anne said with a smirk, Marcy nodded shakily before trying to stand, unable to do so without Annes help, legs still shaky.</p><p>The door was swung wide open by Sasha who was grinning madly with a bottle of water and a towel in hand, confident that her friends finally did it. Her hopes were confirmed when she saw Marcy shaking in her boots, she tossed Anne a bottle of water which the brunette caught before helping Marcy take a sip.</p><p>"I see that you to managed to get a homerun if you know what I mean." Sasha said, partially chuckling as she cleaned up Marcys inner legs that still had cum dripping down the skin.</p><p>"Oh shut up Sash," Anne said as she rolled her eyes. "We'll be back on the road in an hour or two."</p><p>"No, no, take your time, take your time, marcanne."</p>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>Dipper Pines was an omega cervitaur who, unlucky for him, had to deal with estrus, or 'heat' if you want to use common terms, every month or so.</p><p>He has a sister named Mabel Pines who, unlike him, is a beta mermaid, she doesn't have to deal with heat, and even if she did, it wouldn't matter cause she has a girlfriend.</p><p>Dipper, does not have a girlfriend, or a boyfriend, only friends who are girls and friends who are boys.</p><p>It really sucks for him, especially since the local foxwoman Wendy was always in her fox form, the one where she was an alpha instead of an omega like in her human form.</p><p>What Wendy doesn't know is that Dipper is an omega, and that the constant scent she gives off reeks of domination and bliss to Dipper, driving the poor cervitaur insane.</p><p>Its currently nearing the beginning of October and Dipper has started acting differently through Wendys eyes, skittering about constantly and having kicked Mabel out of their room. He's constantly searching for extra bedding and food things among other item that he brings up to his already cluttered room to assort, no one is allowed to set foot in his room now.</p><p>Unbeknownst to Wendy, Dipper is in his preheat, and because of this he doesn't talk to her as much, or anyone in The Shack. He's forced to take extra precaution not to let anything slip, taking time to rethink each word he speaks as his mind tenderizes for heat. He drapes a blanket over his deer half to keep anyone from noticing that his white underfur is stained with excess slick and that his normally brown backfur has splotches that lighten in shade till they become white.</p><p>Out of sheer curiosity Wendy decides to ask Stan whats wrong with Dipper, having a hard time finding a good time of day to ask the satyr about Dipper given her uncontrollable shifts and him being constantly on shift with the tourists.</p><p>Wendys job at The Mystery Shack was unlike the rest of their jobs, she was the only werefox in town, the rest of her family werewolves.</p><p>The werefox population was already low, so her just being there attracted customers, after a week of harassment she got a promotion. She was given a ring for fights, anyone who wants to fight the werefox, a species known to be weak, was allowed to for ten bucks. She always won in a quick bout if it was a human, the longest round taking forty five minutes, due to being summoned at the price of ten bucks anytime, she didn't have a good moment to talk to Stan.</p><p>That wasn't to say she didn't enjoy her job, in fact she loved her job. Mud covering her coat and a crazed flame ignited she fought with the utmost glee, bets were even placed with Mabel usually holding up the booth.</p><p>"Hey Stan," Wendy started as she wiped her muddy paws on the front door carpet, Stan looked up from counting the days haul, a vague notion for Wendy to continue. "You're Dippers great uncle right?"</p><p>"Yep, what about it?" Stan asked as he started to split the cash, Mabel and Dippers piles mainly coins, while Soos and Wendy got bills.</p><p>"Do you know why he's been acting weird lately?" Wendy asked as she walked further in, unbuttoning her mud covered green plaid and hanging it on the jacket rack for employees only, her white shirt underneath muddied only a bit.</p><p>"Course I do," Stan started as Wendy walked up to the counter and reached for her pile, Stan auickly pulling it back. "But if you want to know, it'll cost you five big ones."</p><p>"Sure, whatever, just tell me whats wrong with him, even my calm pheromones don't calm him, I'm a pathetic alpha." Wendy said, muttering the last bit quieter.</p><p>"Of course they don't work, if anything, they make it worse," Stan explained, one of Wendys ears flattened a bit, horizontally displayed as she cocked her fuzzy head the other way. "He's an omega, and he's going into heat without a mate, or anyone he trusts enough to let into his bubble."</p><p>"But it should still calm him, even more so if he's entering heat." Wendy said, her claws clacking against hardwood as she paced back and forth.</p><p>"Look, kid, I'm gonna level with you," Stan said as he handed Wendy her cut in a small lunch baggy. "Dipper is infatuated with you, any whiff of your pheromones makes him go buck wild inside and sometimes outside as well, if you or he had a mate they wouldn't make him go crazy cause he would know they weren't for him and that he can't have you."</p><p>"Then what am I gonna do?" Wendy asked, if Dipper was going buck wild over her pheromones, her scent in general, and him going into heat made it worse, how would she spend time with him, how would she comfort him.</p><p>"Ask him for permission." Stan said blatantly, Wendy froze up and her ears flattened to her head, her tail wagging betrayed her, consciously it was a horrible idea, but the feral alpha in her wanted to ravage that deer and fill him with her pups.</p><p>"Stan, that's a horrible idea, and we're just friends, I don't even want to." Wendy tried to say in her defense, half lying.</p><p>"Wendy, your tails wagging." Stan said matter of factly, Wendy hung her head in defeat, she was outed just like for the little deer.</p><p>"Good point," Wendy said with a sigh, tail stopping movement as she turned to leave in her defeated stupor, perking up the second Dippers scent hit her black nose, dual toned tail quickly picking up pace. "I'll do it right now."</p><p>Dipper skittered into the room, frantically searching for the source of a specific scent he needed for his den to be complete. Then he bumped head first into it, the overpowering aroma hitting him like a train and gripping his antlers gently. His nerves softened and sharpened at the same time as Wendy emitted that calm pheromone, only now noticing Dippers sweet scent.</p><p>"Dipper, I have a question for you." Wendy said as she lowered herself down a bit so that she could be eye to eye.</p><p>"Ask away Wendy, I have one to." Dipper said, voice tense and without a crack.</p><p>"No, no you first." Wendy said, trying to be polite.</p><p>"Could I borrow one of your shirts, I'm going into heat, and need a lot of scents to keep me calm." Dipper asked, a cheap omegan lie to avoid the truth of wanting Wendy to mate him.</p><p>"How about the real thing," Wendy offered, Dippers face darkened and his ears shot up, he stumbled back a bit on his cloven hooves. "I mean, how about I help you out during your heat."</p><p>"W-Wendy, that means mating." Dipper stuttered out, unsure if he was dreaming a beautiful dream.</p><p>"I know, and it sounds lovely to have sub a smart and compassionate omega as my own." Wendy said before releasing a quick burst of her domination pheromone that made Dippers knees shake.</p><p>"You know what, sure," Dipper said before putting out a hand to shake. "I give you my explicit permission to enter my den and take me during this estrus cycle."</p><p>"Alright, see you in a couple days than." Wendy said before returning Dippers hand shake firmly.</p><p>---</p><p>It wasn't a couple days.</p><p>Dipper locked himself in his room after the course of a single day, blocking off the door with towels to prevent his scent from escaping anymore than it needed to. His mind was a tenderized mush by now, and all he wanted in this moment was a meaty filling from an alpha, and lucky him, this would be his last heat without a filling. All he had to now was wait for Wendy to arrive, he stayed huddled up to the shirt she had given him for the time being until the real scent bearer could arrive.</p><p>Wendy, despite being covered in grime made her way to the bathroom with a towel and bathrobe, normally she would be cringing with every move she made with this much grime. She gently opened and closed the door before shuddering a bit, the window left open a crack by the last person, she shrugged it off as she started running the shower. She stripped her mud coated clothing before dropping it into the sink, the room already steaming up with the shower running, she crawled in and started rinsing her fur, aware that Dipper wouldn't recognize her if she ruined her scent with lavender.</p><p>He had told her that she smelled spicy, with an extremely sweet aroma underneath the initial spiciness that would scare off most omegas. He explained how the spicy scent nearly burnt when he smelt it, but was attractive as well, and that the sweet scent only came out when she was relaxed or happy. He made sure to make it a point that she always smelt spicy whenever with Robbie, but he made sure to add the point that she smelt sour first, the sweet side rarely coming out around Robbie.</p><p>What he had explained made enough sense to her, she was only with Robbie for what he could give and what she could get, she had to return to keep it up, but then she fell for him. Things started to go downhill for Wendy from there on out, Robbie having been playing the long con, it was a smart move on his end if she was being honest, honorable in a different setting.</p><p>But now she was gonna have Dipper to keep, and boy oh boy did she ever adore that little deer.</p><p>And this time, she had no con acts running in the background.</p><p>Wendy turned off the shower and stepped out, the cold breeze causing her to shudder. She shook herself down, fur on end and flayed out all around in a mess, it would have to do. She slowly pulled up the bathrobe, it only reached down to just above her knees, she shrugged her shoulders before making her way out, dampening her paws first.</p><p>She made her way up the stairs with a knowing grin on her face, claws gently clicking on the floor as she brushed by Mabel who was flopping on down, a kiddie pool full of water at the bottom of the stairs. She came to a staggering halt when she reached Dippers door, the scent easily penetrating whatever pathetic barriers he put up to block it, she was intoxicated, a rut already starting again as her cock hardened. She took a deep breath before knocking, receiving a weak 'Come in.' before she did exactly that, being greeted with a sight that would alarm most, but looked glorious to her.</p><p>There lay Dipper, his torso planted on his bed, hind legs drenched with slick, occasionally shifting for friction and sweet, sweet release of his heat. Each simple movement he made let off another waft of his sweet, alluring pheromones, Wendy was nearly drooling as she quietly stepped closer, mind going a little bit dumb and feral.</p><p>In ancient times, cervitaur were prey to werewolfs and werefoxes as well, the deep rooted instinct rarely surfacing.</p><p>That's what brought her to this.</p><p>She lunged at Dipper, sinking her claws and fangs into his left flank, crimson drenching her mouth as he yelped and reared back before bucking Wendy off. The werefox was tumbled over dumbfounded, her bathrobe messed up in the process, she stared at the mortified cervitaur whose left flank was bleeding out. It took her a moment to realize what she had done before standing up and covering her mouth her hand, trying to release her calm pheromone that near instantly made Dipper chill.</p><p>"Dipper," Wendy started carefully as she lowered her hands, Dipper nodded as he slowly trotted over to Wendy. "Are you, uh, are you ok?"</p><p>"I'm fine, fine, just do it, just do it to me, now please Wendy." Dipper said, no, he was begging, nearly on his hands and knees, Wendys rut kicking into full gear.</p><p>She gripped his flanks, careful of where she held his left flank  before twisting him around carefully, he planted his front half on the ground as she lined up. She ran her claws across Dippers deer half before gripping the places where his human half and his animal half met before snapping her hips to his haunches, tearing through the barriers that prevented him from getting knocked up.</p><p>Dipper screamed as Wendy tore through him, thrusting without abandon over and over, blood and slick mixing as it spilt out whenever Wendy pulled out to far. She released a snarl when Dipper tried to move before digging her claws into his flesh, left hand tearing open muscle and right hand tearing open red ribbons on his right flank. Within ten minutes, Dippers light brown and white speckled pelt was stained a delicious crimson almost all the way through, and he was starting to go a bit more delirious than before with blood loss.</p><p>Dipper was moaning and wailing out in pleasure with no abandon, Wendys eyes washing over red as she lunged at Dipper, ensnaring his arms between her fangs. His flesh tore open as Wendys knot started to form, slamming against the tight ring of flesh preventing her, the ichor flooding into her mouth and down her throat making her mad for more. She dug deeper and deeper into Dippers forearms, until there was a crack of bone as it splintered away in her mouth, she tore out a chunk of flesh. Dipper screamed before he buckled to the ground, his torso slamming against cushions and blankets alike, everything below him was damp with the blood Wendy had taken from him and spilt.</p><p>Deep in the back of Wendys mind she knew she was going to far, she knew she was never consented to even draw blood, but that uncontrollable need pushed her right over the edge.</p><p>Wendy gripped Dippers abdomen, careful not to tear her mates abdomen wide open, failing to do so. Dippers organs spilt, slipping past her fingers with muscles tearing wide open, blood as well drenching her paws. She yanked him back, claws splitting some of his organs as her knot was forced in and she came, a gush of cum filling Dipper to the brim, impregnating him for sure.</p><p>She released Dipper, aware that what she was doing was wrong in the back of her mind as she raised her claws and tore them down Dippers deer half. The cervitaur screamed out in agony as blood spilt down his human back, drenching his hair as his vision faded out to black. Wendy wanted to cry as her eyes returned to their normal obsidian, she pushed Dippers haunches until she was freed with a painful sensation, she stumbled back to the blood covered floor.</p><p>She was sobbing as she forced herself back to her feet, before staggering over to the window and trying to crack it open. She had to throw her bloody fist through the window, tearing open her skin in the process. She slid through the window next, horribly afraid of what would happen if Stan found her, she fled to the woods in a horribly bloody state.</p>

  <p>Just recently Marcy, Sasha and Anne had all won the battle of the bands together, and in that short free range of time little has happened.<br/>
Anne has been brushing up her skills with her sword with Grimes in preparation of whatever could happen once they make it to Newtopia, better safe than sorry.<br/>
Marcy has been working with Maddie to memorize more potions and spells for the journey they would soon be taking, she knew it was wise in the long run.<br/>
Sasha has been learning how to cook from the local chef who owned the place she stayed at, as she found these tables more comfortable than beds.<br/>
Of course, Sasha learning how to cook allowed her to learn various other properties of certain items in the kitchen, some of which she loved more than others.<br/>
She discovered that boom shrooms, if handled properly, can be turned to a powerful spice when mixed with enough paprika and powdered kraken ink. She was taught about how a newts tail makes the finest delicacy, although the recipes are outlawed in most places, and ingredients hard to find.<br/>
In an alternate vein she learned majority of ingredients, mostly when harvested freshly, could have sexual properties if one was twisted enough.<br/>
She figured out that electric shrooms could be used for electro stim on a level that would be painful for most humans, and that they tasted good after using all electricity. She discovered that mixing dried spider webs with frog or toad saliva made a leathery and sticky substance one could substitute for bondage, the only difference being the color.<br/>
Sasha rarely had a good opening to test these on herself, but she had the night shift to do what she wanted with herself. She had wednesdays off as well, which boded fairly well for her, as those were the days Maddie played with her siblings leaving Marcy alone as well.<br/>
Sasha planned to make good use of that with her boss being extremely lenient so long as she cleaned the tables afterwards.<br/>
With a plan in mind, Sasha trotted over confidently to Marcys wagon and knocked on the door, the ravenette answering after a crash.<br/>
 "Hi Sash, I don't have much time to talk right now, but we can chat while I work." Marcy offered, the brew she was making very time sensitive and a potential threat if she wasn't careful enough, Sasha gave a nod to the offer before being led inside.<br/>
Sasha took a seat on a crate of boom shrooms as Marcy started working away at the bubbling cauldron once again, peppering in varying ingredients. Marcy was locked into focus as she worked away, but Sasha knew she would still be able to hold a decent conversation.<br/>
"Hey Mar Mar, do you remember the time we spent on the roof whenever Anne wasn't at school?" Sasha asked, a faint blush creeping up to her face, Marcys actions halted.<br/>
"Of course I do, but we spent so much time up there doing so many things, how can I be sure we're on the same page," Marcy asked, voice cracking a little bit as she did so, she gave a knowing glance at Sasha. "Maybe you could remind me of the time you're thinking of."<br/>
"When we were... Riled up after sex ed videos, when it started to become a common thing whenever Anne was sick." Sasha said, clearly embarrassed and hoping the memories were ringing true for Marcy as well, and it was clear they were.<br/>
"Right, those times," Marcy said, voice shaky as she poured in powdered stink shrooms, the brew quickly changing from blue to pink. "Any time in specific you enjoyed the most?"<br/>
"That time with the car battery was nice, and I know a way we could redo it here," Sasha said, dragging out a few words as she did so. "I'm free tonight, and so are you..."<br/>
"I guess I am, but I haven't had a chance to figure out how to safely use any of this worlds items." Marcy said, reaching for an excuse, she wouldn't mind having some alone time with Sasha again, but she really had to prepare.<br/>
"Don't worry, I've already tested, and I can handle every ingredient in the kitchen, I can even make us some leather again if you desire it," Sasha offered as she slowly stood, gracefully sauntering over to Marcy, whispering into her ear. "All you have to do is drop by after closing hours."<br/>
"Oh, alright! I'll see you then if you promise it'll just be me and you, I don't want anyone seeing us." Marcy said as she finished off her brew, it was made so she could get off tonight, it would allow her to orgasm with a few simple touches, and until it wore off she would be fine no matter how many times she did orgasm, it basically made her even more sensitive to touches, she was having a hard time with only getting halfway there for quite some time now.<br/>
"I promise, my boss leaves to visit Ivys mother on wednesdays anyways, so no one will see us Mar Mar, that I can assure." Sasha said before dropping a small kiss on Marcys cheek, the latter blushing heavily.<br/>
"S-See you tonight Sash." Marcy said before Sasha left with a sultry grip of the ravenettes hips and a playful wave of her hand.<br/>
"See you in a few, bring whatever you want, you know I'm open minded." Sasha said before closing the door and rushing off to finish her shift at her work, already getting roused by the things they would do.<br/>
---<br/>
Hours have passed since that conversation between the two rooftop lovers, in that time they've both been mentally and psychically preparing. Each knew they could bring something to the table not available on earth, and with that knowledge they found themselves gripping the weirdest items they could find and hopefully work with.<br/>
Sasha already had an entire restaurant's worth of items at her disposal, she simply compiled the ones she liked the most out of the inventory. Her small collection of items mainly consisted of mushrooms and other edible items, with one or two utensils she knew Marcy could figure out how to use.<br/>
Marcy had a lot less to work with in her three person wagon, but she forced herself to make do and scavenge whatever she could from around town. Her small collection mainly consisted of items she knew had odd properties along with various brews she whipped up in the allotted time.<br/>
Both were exceedingly excited, but at the same time worried as well.<br/>
Anne was still in Wartwood, and she still liked to surprise her girls from time to time, the two would be ruined if Anne saw. The only reason that Sasha was bold enough to even try to get some much needed time with Marcy was because Anne was hanging with Ivy and Sprig for the night. If a change in plans came up that either of the two were aware of, they could simply change location or double barricade the doors.<br/>
It was still a long awaited night for both of them<br/>
As Sasha said goodbye to the last customer she put up the closing sign with a long sigh, worn out from her part time gig. She walked over to her boss, he tossed her the keys which she caught skillfully, a smirk on her face. She was given a quick run of the rules once again as the two walked to the backdoor, she had all of them categorized, the most important one being that she cleaned whatever mess she made if it was in the dining room. She gave a quick goodbye as her boss left, she closed the door gently before turning on the shroom lights again, pressing the shrooms gently to keep it dim as the sunset.<br/>
She knew Marcy wouldn't care what was worn, but she couldn't help but care just a bit.<br/>
That was a lie, she was fretting over every small detail.<br/>
Sasha was a bit panicked as she lit up smaller shrooms of different colors and placed them on the tables, she chose mainly red and green shades. She made sure to clear the plates and drop them in the sink as well, wiping down tables and hoping they would dry in time. She gripped her spare work outfit before sliding into it, the outfit looked reminiscent to Annes whem she turned the place into a lily pad thai restaurant, flowy in certain spaces, but in different colors. Her hair was still a mess, but she managed to fix it easily with a few flowers expertly placed among her blonde locks.<br/>
She heard a knock on the back door and rushed to find Marcy dressed in what she always wore with a small bag in her hands. The ravenette blushed when she saw Sasha in her work outfit, she had seen it before, but under the light of what they were going to do made it look a bit more delicious. The way it framed each aspect of Sashas body perfectly, the flowers mixed into blonde locks messily and the somewhat bashful expression she had, it was all beautiful.<br/>
"H-Hi Sash," Marcy started before being led into the kitchen and slowly led into the dining room, eyes stuck on Sashas hips. "What do you want to start with?"<br/>
"Tell me what you've got." Sasha said as she sat on the long, stained wood countertop, spinning seats lined up to it for customers, various condiments left laying across the table as well.<br/>
"I was thinking we could reenact the car battery, or maybe have some fun with ketchup packets again," Marcy offered, Sasha rolled her eyes a bit, regretting doing so as both sounded good, but the habit kicked in. "Of course, if you don't think it'll be enough, having done it before, we could test out this brew that'll make you more sensitive."<br/>
"Will I still have my durability, just a bit more sensitive to touches?" Sasha asked, fully aware that her ability to withstand pain and bodily harm on a near superhuman level was an important part of what they did.<br/>
"Of course you will, I know how important it is for you to have that durability." Marcy said before reaching to pull the thin curtains shut, hoping they would keep away prying eyes in the evening.<br/>
"Perfect, how do I use it, do I just drink it?" Sasha asked as she was handed the pink brew, she swirled it causing it to sparkle.<br/>
"Yep, just drink some of it, I haven't tested it so I wouldn't drink too much though." Marcy said, Sasha raised a brow before popping the cork and downing the entire bottle of the rosy liquid, it tasted impossibly sweet with a tangy aftertaste she savored.<br/>
"That was good, how long till it kicks in?" Sasha asked, shuddering a bit as some chills scattered across her being.<br/>
"Right about," Marcy said pausing until she saw Sasha give a twitch or two, the blondes face turning a deep red as her body ached for touches, the fabric torturing her in its silken softness. "Now."<br/>
"Marcy, if you have anything ready to keep me tame for a bit so you can whip something up, use it, now." Sasha ordered as she disrobed herself, trying not to tear the fabric despite just wanting her rooftop lover to minister off some loving.<br/>
Mary nodded before grabbing a few different powders and liquids and a small bottle, she mixed them all together into a paste before handing it to Sasha. Sasha was unsure of what to do with the item she was given, so she took initiative and just rubbed it across the parts that ached the most, more thick in some spots than other <br/>
At first the substance did nothing, then it burned, and finally it pulled moans from Sasha as waves of pleasure ran through her. She didn't understand it and simply worked on getting herself off, able to get more reactions out of herself, but the speed so far was the same. Under normal circumstances, Marcy would be helping Sasha, but she was working on grabbing dried spider web and elec shrooms with a remote control to mix into something extreme.<br/>
Marcy grabbed a pot in the kitchen, staying there as Sashas moans rang in her ears and echoed in the empty kitchen. Over low heat she started to boil water, then she started to pulverize the elec shrooms, the bits were sparky and dangerous to an average human. Then she dumped in the powdered shrooms and sprinkled in the dried spider web, it was already starting to become sticky and leather like much to her liking.<br/>
Then a held out, delectable, louder than average moan rang throughout the building.<br/>
Marcy knew that sound very well, and she also knew Sasha would not be satisfied just yet having chugged the entire bottle.<br/>
With a hot pot of soon to be applied bondage in two hands, and a spatula between her teeth, Marcy rushed out to find Sasha sitting on the counter.<br/>
The blonde seemed fine if it weren't for the shaking and the liquid dripping down from the edge, she donned confusion. She had never orgasmed so quickly and so easily, the paste was wearing off as well just leaving her hot and bothered with no pleasure at all. She began to whine in withheld pleasure, only quieting down when she saw the spatula be dipped in the faux-leather paste, it was clearly hot.<br/>
"Sash, lie down on your back and don't move an inch, it will be hot," Marcy warned, Sasha nodded before lying down, spreading her arms a bit, Marcy lowered down the spatula to the center of Sashas navel, the blonde froze at the hot sensation as it was globbed on, in an almost web like pattern across her torso and limbs, she jerked when it hit her lower neck. "Sasha, I said be still."<br/>
Sasha whimpered as the tar-like substance cooled, shrinking enough for that delicious tightness that squeezed her in the right ways. Marcy made Sasha flip over before pouring on the rest strategically, Sasha gripped the counter as she hissed in pain, nearly tearing part of it but leaving nail marks. As the fresh substance oozed it gave a weak crackle that Marcy was already working on locking onto with her controller so she could change it up and control it as well.<br/>
"Alright Sash, you have permission to do as you wish," Marcy said, Sasha snapped to attention before desperately groping her tits, her extra sensitive and squeezed skin sending off wave after wave of pleasure through her confused body, she came to a complete halt with a slight yelp when an electrical current ran across her body along the bondage, close enough to her clit and sending enough pleasure over all to trigger orgasm again, it was heaven even though her skin was smoking. "But I might jump the gun from time to time if I want you to alter your form, I'm not saying how though."<br/>
"Isn't that rather cruel?" Sasha panted out before being zapped again, this time she was ready and didn't give a yelp, just gritted her teeth and waited for her burnt skin to stop hurting, her durability extra helpful for stuff like this.<br/>
"I suppose, but even girls like me need the goods from time to time, now have fun, you can use whatever you want, but you're not allowed to touch any condiments or liquidy foods." Marcy demanded, Sasha nodded before standing shakily and searching for her favorite type of shroom, it had a long study stem that was smooth, the bell end was larger than the rest is width, who am I kidding, it looked like a dick and she used it like a dick.<br/>
And Sasha made sure to put on a very good and special show for Marcy who graciously indulged in her own pleasures just a bit, but taking more gratification in watching.<br/>
---<br/>
It had been nearly a week in earth time on Connies world since she had left with Lion, traversing various worlds and universes alike. She found it odd how she was able to survive in most of these crazy places, and how she managed to even get to some of them. Especially the yellow room Cosmic Owl and Primso lived in, the three would hang occasionally, without fear of time passing due to time being suspended in there.<br/>
She had been to so many crazy places and had even more crazy adventures on her way, ones she would never forget. She even started a notebook full of information on the worlds inhabitants, scenery and anything else she found interesting, giving each world a name as well so she could pull up information easier<br/>
The time she spent in the world of Gravity Falls was short lived compared to the rest of the worlds, but a good one, as she had ended up arriving at a very awkward time for Dipper Pines who had the house to himself. For her first time, it wasn't as good as they said it would be until Dipper brought out paranormal tactics and items he had picked up. She stayed for two days in that worlds time gathering more information, only a single day for her worlds time.<br/>
Her visit in the world of Adventure Time lasted a bit longer and for good reason as well, as she ended up stuck between a vampire and a sweet place. That night vey well may have been her bisexual awakening, the part where Marceline turned into a monster bat threw another curve ball at what she knew about herself. The following five days in their worlds time was spent a lot more focused on sex with the extremely unique inhabitants of Adventure Time and less on scenery, only two and a half days in her worlds time.<br/>
Her time spent in the world of Teen Titans was shorter than the last, but felt a lot longer to her despite equating to a similar amount of time. She arrived during the mating season for Beast Boy and Starfires alien equivalent of the phenomena, Raven undergoing heightened libido as well, Robin usually taking all of it. She spent the following three days as Beast Boy, Starfire and Ravens cumslut as they went through heat, only a day and half in her worlds time had passed.<br/>
Connie was beginning to question whether or not she should just head home early, but every time she did, she told herself to stay for just one more world, it couldn't hurt that much. Even her friends in the yellow room agreed with her, despite never touching her aside from high fives, in fact, she even decided to use a Prismo wish for her adventures, her wish was that she could only get impregnated if she wanted to.<br/>
And with her wish working, and a jar of Prismo pickles, she made her way off to the next world.<br/>
---<br/>
With a rolling crash Connie and Lion landed in their next world, greeted instantly with the sound of pleasured moans, but they stopped shortly afterwards. Connie realized the two had been heard and they tried to hide, slowly shuffling as whining rang out, followed by a sharp 'Shush!' that made Connie stifle.<br/>
Connie was hidden under a sink with Lion on top of a cabinet, both hoping their plan of hiding would work as footsteps slowly got closer. Connie covered her mouth and nose to silence her breathing just a bit in her panicked state, then the door swung open and her first instinct was to lunge for it. She quickly threw whoever had her cornered to the ground with a glorious pink blade pressed to their chest, their arms raised flat against the ground in surrender.<br/>
As she slowly calmed down she realized whoever it was had no weapons and the familiar sight of cum on their face, in fact the whole place smelt like lesbian sex. Lion jumped down as Connie raised her blade, the animal licking the substance off the ravenettes face as she slowly stood up, a long, calling moan sounding off as well.<br/>
"I guess I arrived at a rather awkward time for you and someone else, didn't I?" Connie asked sheepishly before putting out a hand to shake, not sure what else to do, still somewhat bashful in these situations despite having interrupted so many times before.<br/>
"Yeah, I'm Marcy by the way, and you might be?" Marcy asked as she shook Connies hand.<br/>
"I'm Connie," Connie said before releasing her grip and pushing a strand of hair behind her ear. "Is there anything I can do for you to make up for crashing your special time with who I assume is the moaning bimbo?"<br/>
"Actually, yes, the person moaning out there is Sasha, my best friend, or as I like to consider us, Morails, but, I need some help pleasuring her, she accidentally had to much of an experimental aphrodisiac," Marcy explained, Connie nodded along, somewhat aware that she wasn't being told the whole story, and that Marcy would be much more worn out if she needed help pleasuring. "Would you be willing?"<br/>
"Absolutely, I've been in situations like this before, just tell me where she is and I'll gladly go down on her." Connie said before being led out to find a strapping blonde.<br/>
Said blonde was lying on a bar counter, moaning as cum dripped off the side of the wooden slab, some form of bondage keeping her squeezed just right. Her hair was askew and her skin looked burnt around where the bondage was, but she still appeared to be in a perfect form of nirvana. Connie could see where she could go from here with what was allotted in a restaurant type area, ketchup bottles looking somewhat alluring to her wandering eyes.<br/>
"Sasha," Marcy started as she stepped closer to Sasha who moaned weakly. "Meet Connie, she'll be giving you a hand."<br/>
"Make the tingling stooop..." Sasha moaned as she writhed a bit for friction, Marcy already taking a seat at one of the booths where she sat prior.<br/>
"Before I begin, Marcy, you seem like the type who loves a good show," Connie said, Marcy nodded a bit. "Is there anything specific you had in mind that you would like me to do your Morail?"<br/>
"I have been meaning to grab the condiments after confiscating her phallic mushroom." Marcy said, Connie nodded before turning to reach for the cylindrical, thin tipped ketchup bottle, it felt near completely full, she turned to walk to Sasha next.<br/>
Connie slowly ran her hands across Sashas skin, the blonde moaning at the touch, her entrance begging to be filled, oozing the stuff. With that now in Connies knowledge, she had decided to save that part for last, the finale for her sex adventure in this world. Connie placed down the ketchup bottle before grabbing one of those mayonnaise squeeze bottles and popping the cap before gently placing the cool edge to right in between Sasha tits.<br/>
Connie slowly squeezed the bottle before dragging it down as a clean line of cool mayo was applied to Sashas burning skin, the blonde squirming and whining to withhold her moans. Connie stopped applying right where it get really sensitive, then she applied diagonal lines that zigzagged on either side of the first line before licking her lips and lowering her face. She stuck out her tongue before dragging it along the first diagonal line, from the left side of Sashas lower abdomen to her nipple, making sure to suck, slowly coaxing orgasm from the blonde who whimpered the entire time as she gripped the table in an attempt to stay still.<br/>
Connie repeated this on the second diagonal line, starting from the top instead, so she started with tongue fucking Sashas nipple and made her way down to nip at Sashas lower abdomen with her teeth. And with the final line, Connie took an exceedingly long time, running her hands across the blondes body as she moaned, nearly cracking the table when Connie squeezed one of her thighs. Connie stood up, all mayo having been removed, she reached down to Sashas legs, spreading them slowly, Sashas skin burning hot against Connies callus covered hands.<br/>
Connie brought the tip of the ketchup bottle to Sashas entryway before jamming it in, the blonde squeaking and tensing up exponentially as the tip sat still. Connie grinned as she slowly squeezed the bottle, Sasha moaning long, breathy moans as Connie pressed her finger against the pleasure point closest to entry, yanking a throaty moan from Sasha as she spilt her load, the juices pushing past the edge of the ketchup bottle. Connie took note and persisted till she was confident that she wouldn't be able to retrieve all of the tomato condiment from Sashas nethers, but for good measure she gave one last spurt of ketchup, wanting the blonde to remember for a while.<br/>
Connie removed the bottle and red mixed with white spilled onto the counter, the traveller dipping her finger before sucking it clean, the flavor delicious. Connie gripped Sashas thighs before pulling the blondes legs over her shoulders, not sure if this would work, but the view was great and she was pretty sure she could manage. Slowly was how Connie ran her tongue across Sashas cunt to clean excess before pushing in the muscle and suckling away, pulling in ketchup and left over cum. Sasha released throaty moans as Connie ravaged her condiment filled pussy while Marcy watched with a smirk while rubbing herself, giving a weak shock that pushed Sasha into an orgasm.<br/>
Connie didn't seem to mind the sudden rush of flavors barreling into her mouth and down her throat as she tried to pull another orgasm from Sasha, moving her hands down to the blondes chest before gripping the pair of breasts she found. She squeezed and occasionally twisted, drawing moans and yelps of approving pleasure from the blonde she was servicing in earnest in the hopes that she would be allowed to leave afterwards. This was still one of Connies best adventures yet, getting to tongue fuck a needy chick and use condiments, something she didn't always have coming her way. She was pretty sure she loved having the audience of one the most, just knowing there was a single judge made her try to do better at what she was doing.<br/>
And with that, she tore a final orgasm from Sasha who screamed in ecstasy, tearing out two chunks of the bar at her highest before coming down as Connie dismounted.<br/>
The brunettes wild ride was over.<br/>
"So," Connie began as she walked over to Marcy who lazily smirked as she sprayed her juices on her hand, standing up shortly after. "Did you enjoy the show?"<br/>
"I loved it, hopefully you come back again sometime soon, I'm sure Sasha would love it." Marcy said before shaking hands, they both giggled when they noticed how sticky their hands were.<br/>
"Well, I should be on my way, bye Marcy, bye Sasha." Connie said as she hopped atop Lion, the pink beast opening a portal before leaping right on through with Connie on his back.<br/>
"Hey Marcy," Sasha started dazedly as she held her head, the aphrodisiac losing its effects. "Can we do whatever we did again?"<br/>
"Sure thing Sash." Marcy said before starting to help Sasha clean up a bit, the two spending far too much time trying to fix the counter.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>Two young warriors have both recently been diagnosed with Chronic Hanaki Disease, CHD for short.</p><p>Both of them were lost in complete and utter disbelief after the first petal had been coughed up.</p><p>Copen had warning, he had given himself a complete medical once over when he noticed his chest was tight, only to find the earliest phase of either Hanahaki disease.</p><p>He just didn't expect it to come so fast, and it happened so swiftly as well compared to a regular patients course until they hit the most agonizing part. The more he thought about his case the faster the flowers grew and crowded his lungs, a side effect he never heard of before was the roots helping bring oxygen into his body for vitamin D and other nutrients sapped from him body.</p><p>Gunvolt had no warning at all when he hacked up the first petal, he felt the tightness in his chest, but he tried to counter by discharging electricity, only to have it enhance growth. By the time the first petal came up he was devastated, he only knew of Fatal Hanahki Disease, FHD, but never CHD. When he kept living for longer than a normal patient of FHD would, Xiao dug deeper for GV, discovering the rarer CHD, which he had been afflicted with, to his relief he would last in a symbiotic relation with the blooms so long as he provided energy.</p><p>It both happened at different times for them as well.</p><p>For Gunvolt he was eating a late dinner with Quinn and Xiao, Joule already asleep as Gunvolt returned home later than he had planned. The three chatted leisurely over the bowls of reheated beef stew until Gunvolt started to cough, to be polite he stood up to exit the room, caught off guard when an odd feeling covered a strip of his tongue. He pulled a large, spotted, milky white-orange petal from his tongue that curved just a bit in a crescent shape, he was appalled as he sat back down at the table with his hand weakly closed around the petal.</p><p>Quinn asked him what was wrong, only to be greeted with a petal being held in his open, palm up hand. She felt her heart drop just like that, equally as devastated for her friend, when Xiao noticed the silence he looked up from his tablet. He nearly dropped the device when he saw the petal in Gunvolts gloved hand, he was absolutely broken, his acquaintance was going to die a horrible death all because of some fool who was to blind to see what a great man Gunvolt was.</p><p>They started to question him instantly, every question he was asked he could barely answer, stuck in a state of shock. Even when they asked who it was, he didn't know, he had no clue how such a thing could happen, he had never been infatuated in his entire life. He was on the verge of tears in minutes as he tried to process the fact his life of destroying Adepts was going to end soon enough, in an agonizing way as well. Even his friends couldn't comfort him as he cried with his head on the table and arms crossed over his head.</p><p>For Copen it happened in mid morning while he was attempting to fix up Lola who had a major problem with her motherboard, Nori taking care of Mytyl for the day as he was too busy to do so himself. He was trying so hard to focus while he ran his fingers across Lolas motherboard in search of the crack he knew was there, but her constant... Moaning, wasn't helping him. He went to tell her to shut up with a threat about cutting her speakers permanently, but he was cut off by a horrendous coughing fit, something caught in his throat.</p><p>He turned his spinning chair before bending nearly in half as he clutched his stomach, hacking relentlessly until whatever was stuck in his throat started to move up the passage. When he felt whatever was in his mouth hit the back of his throat he raised his hands to catch whatever came out, having a decent idea of what it was. When he felt the various items roll off his tongue and land in his hand, he raised his head and leaned back, feeling quite off balance after the fierce coughing fit.</p><p>He looked in his hands to find three, somewhat spiky, purple petals in his two, gloved hands, he was only a little bit confused about what was in his hands. He had a good idea of finding a blood red petal or two in his hands, having found that roses are commonly the flora of a Hanahaki sufferer of either variety. He called for Nori, she arrived with Mytyl at her side, worried about her brother. He asked her what the petals were from and she said she had never seen a type of petal like that in her life, he gave an 'Oh.' before starting on his work again.</p><p>Both of them had no clue who had caused it, but they each had a gut feeling it didn't make sense, as Hanahaki of any variety normally triggered for unrequited love, and one would know if they loved…</p><p>Right...?</p><p>They weren't exactly sure, but what they were sure of was the fact they didn't desire crossing paths again, as it always seemed to cause their chests to swell with blooms of longing.</p><hr/><p>Location: Abandoned Manor</p><p>Time: 11:20 PM</p><p>Gunvolt traversed the building with a forced ease and fluidness as he activated his Flashfield and shot his gun, his chest tightening with every breath he took.</p><p>Every time he used his Flashfield, he felt the flowers grow in a sudden burst, the stems and leaves crowding his lungs as the flowers grew. He had to pause and take a moment to cough every now and then, mostly leaves came up due to the nature of the plant in his lungs, a lily of some sort. He rarely got a petal to fall from between his lips, but when he did it hurt the most, as the flower bloomed before dropping a petal that was hacked up.</p><p>By the time he reached the room he suspected belonged to the lady in charge of this place, he was light headed from coughing, his throat dry and stinging. If he was in a later stage of Hanahaki, then it wouldn't sting as much on the way up with blood allowing his throat to stay moist, he didn't think of where the blood came from. But at the same time he knew he should just focus on the job at hand and hurry up and get rid of her before she did something she would soon regret.</p><p>With an unsteady gait, he made his way through the door.</p><hr/><p>Location: Prism Highway</p><p>Time: 7:48 PM</p><p>Copen practically glided across the highway even with the weight of the flowers in his lungs, his body seized whenever he took a deep breath.</p><p>Copen had designed a feature in his jacket to help compress the flowers in his lungs, he called the feature binding, he basically stitched a binder into his coat. He knew all too well it wouldn't end well for him no matter what he did, so he tried to make the most of it. The flowers in his chest would either end up stronger after binding, leaving him feeling tighter and harder to breathe, or the flowers would weaken greatly after binding, allowing him to breathe easy once again.</p><p>His knees were shaking a bit as he forced himself to run straight when the meeting point came into view, he was ready to sit down until Nori rode in on her bike. His form was taxed a bit more than usual when he hopped onto her bike and steadied his footing before giving the ok to go. As soon as she did, the added air compression forced him into falling off as he struggled to breathe, hacking up petals and few near spiked leaves as he did so, he was gripping his chest in pain.</p><p>With a lie of painlessness, he hopped back on the bike.</p><hr/><p>Location: Quinn and Xiaos apartment</p><p>Time: 3:00 PM</p><p>Gunvolt sat on the couch with a stainless steel bowl in his lap, it was full of leaves and flowers, he wanted to watch TV but he couldn't focus on it.</p><p>"It doesn't make sense," Gunvolt groaned as he threw his head back, he heard a stem snap. "I should be dead any minute now, hell, I've been in the dead zone for weeks."</p><p>"That's because it might not be fatal." Xiao said before clicking yet another link to a clinical site with information on Hanahaki disease, skimming for details he hadn't already read.</p><p>"Please, everyone knows all Hanahaki is fatal." Gunvolt said in disbelief at what Xiao was saying.</p><p>"Actually, it isn't and according to this, and many other sites I've checked, there's actually two documented types with two documented triggers," Xiao explained, taking a pause when Gunvolt started to hack up some bloodied blossoms and leaves, his face smattered with blood. "There's the more commonly known Fatal Hanahaki Disease, FHD, and the lesser known and rare Chronic Hanahaki Disease, CHD, I'm assuming you have CHD."</p><p>"I guess that would make sense." Gunvolt said with a sigh as he reached for a cup of water, his throat ached.</p><p>"The first trigger is unrequited love, not always at first site, the second trigger is undying lust, commonly at first site," Xiao explained, Gunvolt seemed a bit uneasy at the idea of flowers growing in his lungs were caused by his libido, but it opened a few doors. "Patients of CHD often report that the disease never leaves but is eased when the trigger is relieved, unrequited love can be relieved by spending time with the on who triggered it while undying lust can be relieved by doing the na-"</p><p>"Right, I get the picture, Xiao." Gunvolt said, waving his hands as he gestured a bit, not needing to hear the end of the sentence</p><p>"Now that thats on the table, anyone come to mind, GV?" Xiao asked with a smirk on his face as he leaned in towards Gunvolt who edged back, face turning red.</p><p>"Only two, and even then the second one is just fascination, not exactly lust," Gunvolt said, Xiao gestured for Gunvolt to drop some names. "It's either Zeno or The Adept Slayer."</p><p>"Hmm, the guy who tried to kill you gave you a boner, sounds rough." Xiao said, smirking a bit, Gunvolt shuddered, but it wasn't off the table as a possibility.</p><p>"Definitely not," Gunvolt said, lying to an extent, the hunter was never the cause of a boner, only the cure to a boner. "Besides, its probably Zeno, I've, I've had something for him for longer than I remember."</p><p>"Lets say it's Zeno and forget that The Adept Slayer was even an option." Xiao offered, Gunvolt nodded before hacking up flowers again, this time stems came up as well.</p><hr/><p>Location: Kamizono Manor</p><p>Time: 12:24 PM</p><p>Copen sat at the table with his little sister and Nori, indulging in a delicious bowl of beef stroganoff, the sauce soothed his aching throat.</p><p>"Nori, you had the Hanahaki Disease, right?" Copen asked gingerly, he felt something start to inch up his throat as he spoke.</p><p>"Yes, but they died shortly before I took up taking care of your family, with them dead, the flowers died," Nori explained solemnly, her voice somehow stable. "I'm grateful they died, if not I would've died in my case of FHD in mere days, even then the recovery was rough."</p><p>"FHD...?" Copen asked, unaware of the term.</p><p>"Fatal Hanahaki Disease, mine was triggered due to unrequited love, I had a friend with undying lust triggered CHD, she's been taking care of herself I've heard," Nori explained before taking a seat with Copen and Mytyl before starting to eat. "CHD stands for Chronic Hanahaki Disease, I hear its much rarer than Fatal Hanahaki Disease and has surgeries that can be done to ease the pain."</p><p>"Oh, so, maybe that's whats wrong with me." Copen said, the tightness in his chest bursting as he thought about his case, he clutched his chest before turning to leave, only able to get one step before he collapsed with blood and purple petals streamed from between his lips with a barking cough.</p><p>"Copen, are you alright?!" Nori questioned as she rushed to Copens side, the hunter giving a shaky nod as his arms shook and his head spun a bit, accursed human body.</p><p>"Yeah, its fine, I've been dealing with it for a while now, just didn't tell you." Copen explained as he stood up again, Nori helping him, he sat back down before eating some more.</p><p>"Copen, we'll be having a talk shortly after Mytyl falls asleep." Nori said sternly, Mytyl clearly concerned for her brother, Copen nodded as he smudged the blood on his lips in an attempt to wipe it off.</p><p>"Is Copen gonna be ok?" Mytyl asked, her speech assistance device having a hard time delivering the emotion, but her expressions and mannerisms spoke volumes in the tone she tried to express.</p><p>"Don't worry, Mytyl, I promise you I'll be ok, I'll check in with you after every mission, I'll even leave a flower in a vase for you if you're asleep." Copen said, his tone and heartfelt look indicating he was promising it to Mytyl who gave a nod.</p><p>"Is everyone done with their meal, if so I made dessert as well." Nori asked, both Mytyl and Copen nodded, just a bit excited about Noris cooking as she always made delicious food.</p><hr/><p>They both found Orchids within their lungs whenever they suffered for the object of their desire.</p><p>For Copen he found varying blue petals often red with blood to dominate over the purple petals of Cornflower that came up much more often.</p><p>For Gunvolt he often found the red and white petals to be an accent to the bloody milky-orange petals of a lily that came up whenever he coughed.</p><p>They both found it odd that Orchids came instead of roses, but on the same note they found it to be a nice touch compared to the usual colors they found in the sink or on the side of a road.</p><p>They still hadn't the slightest who it was for.</p><p>Gunvolt and Xiao had continued to do their fair share of research on the matter, discovering many important things on CHD, the biggest one being if the trigger dies, so will the CHD. When Gunvolt found that Zeno died while he was watching the news one night, he burst into a coughing fit due to sorrow of his friends passing, but in the following week the disease didn't weaken. It was that week Gunvolt ended up trying to find a potential third candidate for the trigger of his disease.</p><p>Copen and Nori had that talk they agreed to after Mytyl had fallen asleep, Copen answered the questions asked, and listened intently to everything else she said about what little she knew of CHD. He came to the conclusion of trying to kill off or weaken the flowers that flourished in his lungs, getting Noris permission as well as he was aware this 'cure' could cause even more damage. He started smoking, the first few had him weak, but once he got used to it he was fine and the flowers weakened.<br/>
Both of their choices made little difference in the long run of things.</p><p>Full flowers spilt from between their slightly torn lips as the clock ticked, Edens plans slowly progressed as they tried to stop it without letting the flowers get in the way of their own methods of stopping Eden.</p><p>But even they couldn’t stop the intangible pulls of fate that had them linked together with an unbreakable red string, the two of them almost always catching passing glances of each other on the way back from missions but choosing against conflict for varying reasons.</p><hr/><p>Location: ???</p><p>Time: ???</p><p>Three hours.</p><p>Three entire hours and Copen was already sure he was too late to save the only person he had left to care about in this world.</p><p>His sister, she could be dead already cause he was too slow.</p><p>His way through Eden was a rush job to try and make it.</p><p>The urgency was different for Gunvolt.</p><p>He had been alerted two days back that Eden was starting its plan.</p><p>He was unable to leave as soon as he wanted to because Quinn kept him home till she was sure he was prepared.</p><p>Now he was hurrying his way through, but had nothing to fear losing except freedom.</p><p>They both were equally scared and let it show differently.</p><p>Copen was frantic where Gunvolt was aggressive.</p><p>Gunvolt was violent where Copen was agile.</p><p>But they both couldn’t think straight and where light headed due the increasing tightness in their chest and flowering vines bursting from between their torn and bruised lips.</p><p>Copen couldn’t help but avoid conflict whenever possible as he dashed through, unable to bring himself to have a steady shot, his body shook with fear and the bloating pain in his chest.</p><p>Gunvolt threw himself into conflict as he trudged his way through, his shots were shaky but he couldn’t tell as his body cackled with static, convincing the flowers to burst in growth.</p><p>They both were struggling as they pressed forward.</p><p>Copen arrived first to the fight with Zonda, he could feel how crowded his lungs were, how bloated his chest was, he didn’t like it.</p><p>He kept pressing on and pressing on, the pain of the wounds matched with the pain of the longing in his torso, it hurt.</p><p>Gunvolt arrived shortly after Copen had finished Zonda off, finding the slayer to be holding a deceased childs form.</p><p>He tried to walk closer to the slayer, to ask what was wrong and who the child Copen was holding, he couldn’t manage.</p><p>As soon as he stepped close enough to Copen to be noticed, the Adept Slayer snapped to face Gunvolt with a face and torso muttered in blood with petals sticking to iron enriched crimson. He looked deranged, broken, without purpose, he was completely distraught, tears pricked the corners of his eyes. If it weren’t for the body's perfect condition one could assume he just tore out the girls throat and indulged.</p><p>Gunvolt was horrified, all too aware of what he was seeing on Copens' form, Hanahaki.</p><p>“Copen-” Gunvolt tried to say, cut off by Copen who barked at him.</p><p>“You did this!” Copen shouted, his voice was raw.</p><p>“Copen, I didn’t kill the girl, I would never kill an innocent child!” Gunvolt snapped in response, his voice breaking into coughs as he spoke, the blood bubbling in his throat dripping between the stitches that implied where he was sliced open to remove stems and vines.</p><p>“It was because of Adepts like you that Mytyl died! She did nothing wrong!” Copen barked at Gunvolt, standing before staggering over to the Adept and pressing a finger to his chest, the static that transferred caused him to break into a coughing fit, he would’ve fallen to the ground if not for Gunvolt.</p><p>Copen hacked and coughed over Gunvolts shoulder, blood spilling from between his lips and trailing down Gunvolts jacket mixed with petals and flowers that came up as well. He was trying to get out snide insults but was unable to do so, only able to feel the intense swell in his chest as he pressed closer to Gunvolt by a welcoming electric touch that was so… Nice.</p><p>He didn’t understand it, he didn’t like it, he didn’t want it to feel good.</p><p>That wasn’t to say he didn’t need someone to give him a hand dealing with the whole Hanahaki thing, and he was finding that there were some connections he wasn’t exactly enjoying.</p><p>And that electricity did feel nice, even dampened by the layers of clothing.</p><p>Copen pushed away from Gunvolt, iron filled his mouth but he was desensitized to his own taste, he bore a look of disgust at what he felt. Gunvolt bore a similar look, probably having felt and realized similar things that Copen did, the only thing being he wasn’t spilling blood except for the telltale dribble of blood down the slit in his neck.</p><p>“Fuck, it’s you, you stupid Adept,” Copen snarled as he brushed himself down, the static on his clothing giving weak crackles. “Of course it's you.”</p><p>“Guess Xiao was right, the guy who tried to kill me did give me a boner.” Gunvolt said, having lost his filter near completely due to sudden shock, Copen felt a bit disgusted at the statement, all too aware he underwent the same predicament after every time they fought.</p><p>“Well? What now, Adept-” Copen said, being cut off by Gunvolt.</p><p>“Gunvolt, Azure Striker Gunvolt, if I’m the target, use my name.” Gunvolt said, rubbing his arm a bit, his chest bloated a bit, he jerked forward before flowers lurched from between his lips coated in a veneer of blood, Copen instinctively went to support him.</p><p>“Striker, I suppose we could at least try and find a middle ground,” Copen stated as he held Gunvolts shoulders, making sure the Adept was standing straight and holding eye contact of blue and red. “I don’t like dealing with this disease anymore than I assume you do.”</p><p>“Is it chronic? Is it love? Give me something to work with here.” Gunvolt said smugly, withholding a smirk as he was thrown to the ground, instantly pinned with a foot on his chest.</p><p>“Chronic, lust, yours?” Copen demanded in a tone that oozed with dominance, Gunvolt felt the flowers burst, he gave a wheeze as air was forced from his lungs.</p><p>“Same.” Gunvolt said before gripping at Copens ankles, Copen smirked before kicking Gunvolt aside, Gunvolt grinned, loving how cruel Copen still was.</p><p>“So, our middle ground isn’t gonna be savory then, I suppose I can work with that,” Copen said before walking over to Gunvolt, crouching down beside the Adept who was already leaning on his elbows and delighted to see the twisted yet smug look on Copens face. “I expect you to put that Septima of yours to good use, Striker.”</p><p>“And I expect you to be as fierce as you are in battle, Slayer.” Gunvolt said with a slight edge to his voice, Copen already had a hand pressed to his shoulder, pushing down before twisting and yanking, catching the Adept off guard before they were locked in a kiss.</p><p>It was everything but skillful with the blood smeared across their faces.</p><p>They were both fierce and Wouldn’t give even an inch to the other, Copen brought his other hand to Gunvolts collar before pushing back and yanking again, nearly bashing their noses together. Gunvolt was agile, swiftly bringing his hands to Copens neck and sending pulses of electricity that rocked his system in mere seconds. The linger of static on Copens neck was bliss as he released Gunvolt, the Adept falling to the floor, pulling Copen down as well due to a reflexive grabbing of anything stable.</p><p>Copen wasn’t exactly one to show submission, but right now, submission was looking mighty fine if he was gonna get a healthy dose of electricity shot through his veins.</p><p>The thought was torn from him when Gunvolt raised his knee and flipped their position, using the bend as leverage, leaving Copen on the ground. He thrashed around for a bit before Gunvolt lowered his hand to Copens neck again and shot a dose of electricity into him, he went docile for only a few seconds. In an instant Gunvolt dropped his right knee to press against Copens diaphragm, yanked off his jacket and pulled off his gloves, already painfully horny.</p><p>Copen roused from his short compliance before realizing he couldn’t breath, he jerked a knee and bruised Gunvolts inner thigh, the Adept dropping his knee lower and pressing hard, forcing a few sounds from Copen. Now, the sounds Copen produced weren’t exactly moans, or mewls, or groans, they were a different category, but that didn’t deter Gunvolt at all, not when his chest was finally loosening up as the flowers weakened.</p><p>Copen was feeling it too.</p><p>And it was heavenly.</p><p>All at once their chests were no longer bloated, slowly shrinking in size as the flowers withered away with each advance they made in their lustful duet.</p><p>As the opposite of love is fear, the opposite of lust is hate, they were dancing on a thin line, and the rush of adrenaline that came with said knowledge only made them long even more.</p><p>Gunvolt led this duet while Copen followed and tried to mimic the actions from his position to repay the pleasure, it was like looking in a mirror, the only difference being the stitched slit running down Gunvolts neck. Copen yanked Gunvolt down, running an incisor along the soft and warm and bloody opening in Gunvolts neck, the Adept shuddered with a moan of disgusted pleasure. Copen repeated the action, able to feel the Adept freeze when he tugged at a stitch and tense when he delved deeper, it felt so different and new.</p><p>Such an odd sensation, mixing blood and mixing pleasure, it all swirled together.</p><p>Gunvolt shot another few volts of electricity through Copen, coating the slayers body in an electric tingle all at once, it tore a shout of ecstasy from Copen that petered off into a moan, his body going limp after a quick spasm.</p><p>With Copen limp, Gunvolt was left to sit in the silence of labored breathing or jack one off.</p><p>He chose option number two.</p><p>“Wait,” Copen started between labored breaths as he sat up a bit, Gunvolt halting. “Just, just gimme a minute and I can help you with that, Striker.”</p>

  <p>How many times has she been kidnapped now?</p><p>At least a hundred it felt like.</p><p>And she's noticed subtle changes over each of her kidnappings.</p><p>Shredder loved to keep her tied up in a heavy duty rope that chafed at first, but now he's went from heavy duty to fishing twine to what looked like twizzler licorice.</p><p>And she's enjoying it.</p><p>Sure, this time she was stripped down to naught but her panties and bra, of all the days she chose lace. She quite liked the way the rope squeezed her in all the right spots, the it constricted her thighs and framed her chest, pulled so tight her flesh seems to bubble between strands. Her hair had been braided today, one short, yet thick, braid resting on her back, almost like a handle.</p><p>And so as always, Shredder turned on the interrogation light and entered.</p><p>"April O'Neil, its been quite some time since we've last seen each other, hasn't it?" Shredder asked as he circled April, in a fashion similar to that of a shark.</p><p>"I suppose it has, Shredder," April said, already able to feel a prick of fear forming in her stomach. "Although before we continue this interrogation, I must ask, why choose such sensual ropes and have me wrapped in such a suggestive way."</p><p>"Over the years I thought I might spice it up for you, kidnappings get bland without some spice." Shredder stated simply, grip on the controller behind his back tightening, thumb hovering over the button.</p><p>"Hmm, spice, you want spice?" April asked in a coy manner, a smile gracing her face, she nearly moaned when Shredder tugged on her braid.</p><p>"Yes I would love some spice, only if your up for things to get hot in the kitchen of amour." Shredder stated, he had worked on that line for weeks and it sounded horrendous.</p><p>"I doubt you could be much better than any of the turtles, but sure, why not, maybe I'll give you some information once we're finished." April said, crying out when the rope tightened, it would leave marks for sure.</p><p>"Good, cause I've been waiting for this a long time." Shredder said as he yanked the chair from under April who managed to catch herself despite the tenser like proprioception of her muscles and joints.</p><p>She pulled herself to the chair, her arms resting on the seat and knees on the ground, unable to spread due ti tightness. The rope loosened and she spread her legs, panties already damp with an almost sickening arousal she held for restraints. She was shuddering as a claw threatened to tear her delicate flesh open as it slit pathetic fabric, the claw was retracted. A rough finger pressed to her entrance which gave way with ease, a second easily welcomed as well due to the stretching that mutated turtle cocks allowed.<br/>And so, the rope gripped her again, slithering slowly across her skin as Shredder worked her loose, claws nicking her inner thighs. She shuddered when the rope loosened again heard a rustle of fabric, she went to turn and get a view, but with the press of a button she couldn't move her neck with how tight the string was. The tip was pressed to her entrance and she loosened instinctively, the time she spent with Raph taught her that loose is better in penetrative situations.</p><p>Shredder slowly worked his way in, his time around the mutants and mutagens caused few ridges to form across the surface. He started slow as he pulled in and out, in and out, but when he finally found his smooth yet fast pace he was gripping the string for support. His fingers dug into Aprils plush ass, thighs and hips, claws sending chilling shudders up her as the ridges ran across her g spot.</p><p>She was moaning like a whore in no time, her body shaking as the string rhythmically loosened and tightened on her form. Every third thrust in it would tighten so much she felt like snakes held her, and every second pull out it would loosen so much she swore it was falling off. She loved it to say the least, nothing could beat Mikey serving himself a pizza feast over her form, a night she'll never forget, but this is up there. And the ridges on the object of intrusion only made things so much better, it felt just like the toy Donnie had made for her.</p><p>By the time Shredder had peaked April was bruising from her constraints and the fluid filling her pushed her that last bit over the edge and she released a languid moan. Shredder pulled out and wiped himself down with Aprils undershirt stored in the corner of the room before yanking his pants back on. April on the other hand was panting, barely able to move, the strings loosened and she gripped her chair as she crawled into sitting on it, Shredder opposite to her.</p><p>She had to give information now in return for a banging time with the leader of the Foot Clan.</p><p>Shredder cleared his throat before asking his first question.</p><p>"Whats Leonardo like in bed now?"</p><p>"A fucking pillow princess beyond pillow princess."</p><p>Shredder nodded a bit before jotting down a note with a pencil and paper she hadn't noticed until now.</p><p>"Ok, how about Raphael."</p><p>"He will tear you in half with his cock if you ain't loose."</p><p>It almost appeared Shredder was surprised at such a statement coming from her.</p><p>"And Mikey, what about him?"</p><p>"Hes playful and would say yes to anything if asked."</p><p>Shredder nods as though nothing has changed since last time he heard such things about the turtles.</p><p>"Lastly, my favorite, Donatello, how is he?"</p><p>"He fucked me with a beaker full of something once."</p><p>It doesn't answer very much about his question but he still writes down.</p><p>With everything he wanted to know he stands before exiting, Foot Soldiers filter in and redress her, one handing her coffee. She drank the coffee before the Foot Soldiers lead her out of the gridlock base in lockstep, she followed a little bit tired as the caffeine kicks in until she's out the door.</p><p>What a lovely kidnapping, she can't wait to tell the turtles.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>You and your dearest Ramona Flowers have been dating for a few months now, nearly a year actually, and in those months lots has happened.</p><p>Wallace had finally landed himself a boyfriend that stuck around for much more than that significant ass, he suspected this one would get a night or two of good times and leave so he was shocked when he proposed.</p><p>Kim had found a new band to play in from time to time despite never leaving Sex Bob-omb, the same band she was now playing with also had a lovely lady singing that she was heavily planning on learning more about.</p><p>Nega Scott and regular Scott had been caught going at it hard in the middle of a mausoleum, it was very, very hard to explain that to Knives who was going on a stroll before being greeted with the languid moans of Scott.</p><p>And you and Ramona have come to an agreement in your relationship as well around the topic of sex.</p><p>Its free use, for the both of you, anywhere anytime, whether you be finishing a project for work or she be cooking up a storm, you two will drop it and fuck. Or not drop it and fuck, instead deal with the distraction of a tender blow job, or perhaps somewhat rough groping, its a wild game.</p><p>On more than one occasion have you woken up to find your girlfriend palming and grinding against you, shes never woken up to you doing anything to her though, and you have big plans to change that.</p><p>Its a Saturday night in Toronto and you and Ramona have just finished your movie, it had an awkward sex scene, and you both seem fine. But you really aren't fine and want a piece of that ass STAT, but no, you play out your plan and yawn, it isn't fake, but just dramatic. She follows your yawn as though its a contagious thing and she gives her arms a stretch, her shirt riding up her midriff easily and you can't help but stare at the slim, almost muscled stomach shown.</p><p>"Well, I don't know about you, but I'm feeling pretty sleepy babe," Ramona states before standing up, her skirt she wears to sleep in winter so she doesn't freeze but can easily remove clings to her skin a bit and you can just tell she isn't wearing anything underneath. "I'm heading off to bed, you can join whenever you want."</p><p>"Alright Flower, I'll be there once I finish the dishes." You lie, you both know there isn't that many dishes left, and that it shouldn't take to long to finish, but you're gambling on Ramona falling asleep rather fast tonight.</p><p>"Don't take to long, you know it gets pretty chilly in these winter months with the insulation kind of fucked." Ramona said as she turned leave on her merry way.</p><p>"I know," You say, causing her to turn towards you for a second. "I'll look into getting it fixed soon."</p><p>"We both know I'm a working woman." She says with a smug grin that makes shudder before she turned away.</p><p>She saunters off to bed and you can hear the gentle 'click' of the shared bedroom door as it opens and then a second time as it closes. A slight, muted shuffle and you can be sure shes in bed, you give a silent sigh of relief before standing up and making your way to the sink. You didn't plan on actually doing the dishes, but it'll kill some time as you wait for Ramona to drift into dreamland, it usually takes her thirty minutes to an hour you've found.</p><p>The clatters of dishes against each other mixed with the splash of water from the sink is harmonious and loud, but she has headphones on falling asleep to Metallica or Nine Inch Nails. You're almost caught in a dish washing trance so intense you forget how riled up you got after that sex scene in the movie. It had rimming, and it was gay, you both made references to the situation of the Pilgrim duo while it rolled in an awkward attempt to avoid paying attention. You hum gently to yourself as you work away until theirs no dishes and twenty minutes have passed, you spend the following ten minutes debating over whether or not you should titfuck Ramona or rim Ramona.</p><p>Its a tough choice, but you come to the conclusion that just rimming her would lower the chance of her waking up instantly. You still want her to have that sudden confusion in the midst of waking up to someone at least halfway through the act, not just waking up at the start of it all and being able to say no easier, even though your deal says you have to agree. Of course, you would never ever abuse the sacred free use agreement the two of you had come to the conclusion of five months back after you got your own shared apartment.</p><p>You heave a shaky breath before heading to your room, disrobing your shirt on the way, cause fabric against fabric is shockingly loud in the silence of the night. You slowly tiptoe as you make your way back, curling your toes each time as you place down your foot, you were wearing thick, fuzzy socks to muffle sound, Ramona complimented the pink fuzz earlier in the day so you knew she knew. You twisted the door handle and pulled it while pressing your other hand against the door, you repeated said actions as you entered the room lit by naught more than a lava lamp in the furthest corner.</p><p>You press the door closed the same way you opened it and go to step further into the carpeted room, distracted by the bra your foot nudges against. You look further ahead and find Ramonas skirt is hanging off the edge of the bed, well isn't that crazy convenient for you, how lucky, you give an internalized silent thanks before pressing on. Shes under one of the blankets you have and fell asleep on her side, you can't help but smile softly at how perfect she is despite the devious acts you plan on committing very, very soon.</p><p>You slowly bring yourself to bed and carefully crawl onto the creaking mattress, Ramona shifts slightly and you freeze before returning, shes a deep sleeper so she must be dreaming. Once you've finished awkwardly situating yourself to be parallel to Ramonas ass, it took a while and you nearly woke her up when you shifted the blankets to fast. You run your hands across the perfect globes of her ass, bountiful, plush, but not overboard and completely human, you learned that from Scott who got slapped for asking if she had implants. You could just lay there all night long, teasing and pressing fingers against her ass and inner thighs, watching the warm flesh give under your touch, but no, you had a plan, and despite everything, you're sticking with that plan.</p><p>Even though you totally wouldn't mind just railing Ramona into next week and-!</p><p>No, bad thoughts, focus.</p><p>You chastises yourself for a few minutes before running a thumb down the cleft of her ass, she shifts slightly, you continue as you slide the second thumb between. You slowly separate her cheeks to find her backdoor, its looks like every other asshole does, but it looks better than the pic the homeboy took for you once, so you can now be sure Ramona looks better than you over every square inch of her body. Your starting to doubt your idea just a bit, but! But, but, but, she had a shower before the movie, so you can be sure that pucker is clean of gunk, that is the motivational boost you require to dive in.</p><p>First, you press your thumb to it to test just how tight it is, very tight apparently, you honestly don't know what you expected. Second you bring your face closer and closer till you can swipe your tongue over it. You're also sure you may or may not suffocate if your grip falters, but ass suffocation is a good way to go, they'll laugh at your funeral, here lies Y/N, death by ass suffocation. You refrain from chuckling as you think of it, now, instead you press the top of your tongue flat against her hole before dragging it up the crack, you can swear she must be waking up. You proceed to circle the pucker with the tip of your tongue to the best of your ability, pressing a finger to her backdoor as well, finding a bit more give than before.</p><p>And so you continue in such a manner until theres enough give that you can dip your tongue in, when it happens you nearly recoil in instinctive disgust before realizing organ was empty of waste. After coming to that conclusion you continue just like so, eating her ass out the same way you ate her pussy out last month while she was cooking dinner. In fact, you draw a finger across her taint to her entrance before gently pushing in, finding it to be slick, lovely, she must be dreaming.</p><p>"Sc... Scott..." She practically moans in her sleep, shes really just mumbling, you feel offended she dreams of such a bitch and retaliate by sucking, she tenses. "Scott never- never better than... You..."</p><p>You feel reaffirmed by that statement and continue rimming Ramona, plunging a finger into her pussy as well, gently brushing that easy access sweet spot. She continues to mumble sweet nothings in her sleep until she starts to give quaint moans along with such pieces of sleepy praise she utters. She starts to shift and tense occasionally as well, like she always does when shes edged closer and closer to her sweet relief, you smirk.</p><p>You slip in a second finger and force your tongue deep as it goes and she orgasms.</p><p>Instead of waking up, she rolls onto you, instead of accepting ass suffocation as fate, you slap her ass and she shoots up, jumping to the side.</p><p>Ramona wears a look of fear on her face, arched into a fighting stance until she finds you with a smug grin on your face, splotch of cum on the bed and that same relief running down her legs. She can't stay mad at you, she really can't, so she lies down in bed again, you can clean sheets tomorrow, and slowly pulls you into a kiss before speaking her oppinion.</p><p>"You sly bastard, I love you."</p><p>"I love you to."</p><p>"I can't wait to wake up to that again."</p><p>"Really?"</p>

  <div class="k31gt">
    <p>Its been a good long five years since the Pines Twins came to Gravity Falls for the first time.</p>
  </div>
</div><div class="k31gt">
  <p>And despite all that time on the outside, not much has changed on the inside.</p>
</div><div class="k31gt">
  <p>Robbies still pathetic with the girls, turns out he swings both ways, took him long enough is Mabels opinion, she figured that out when she was fifteen. Pacifica is still bratty and has regained her wealth over the years with a Bill Cipher deal shes already regretting, what an idiot is Dippers opinion, even if he wasn't a paranoid freak he would know better. Wendy and Tambry are still hanging out with one another, they've even become something more than friends, good for them is Mabel and Dippers opinion, as they make quite the cute couple.</p>
</div><div class="k31gt">
  <p>Although Dippers young puppy crush on Wendy still lingers and on their third summer that puppy crush transferred to Tambry and thats still going pretty strong despite having a good tie in with his paranormal buddy Dib. Him and Dib are just friends with benefits though, he definitely is not ready for the sexuality talk yet, but his heart does flutter whenever anyone compliments him and he can't deny that. He still wants to have a good time with the Gravity Falls girls though, and he could never deny himself such delicious fantasies of Pacifica melting in his hands, Wendy teaching him how its done and Tambry showing him something new and amazing.</p>
</div><div class="k31gt">
  <p>Or even if its a simple fantasy in his mind, and one much less lewd, he can't turn them off with the flick of a switch nor does he want to. In fact, he adores it when he gets a sweet daydream of him and Wendy going on a romantic date that involves hunting paranormal creatures. He can even be found at the counter of the Mystery Shack dozing off to such daydreams, only to be woken up by Mabel or Soos, both of which have better jobs in the shack than he does.</p>
</div><div class="k31gt">
  <p>Mabel restocks shelves and Soos runs the place, its come so far since when he first saw the rundown shack in the woods and decided to have a hearty dose of questioning if his parents were sane sending him here. Sure, him and Mabel still share a cramped attic room and it gets beyond awkward sometimes if Mabel walks in on him jacking one off, or vice versa. And sure, sometimes its hard stocking food for two almost fully developed humans, one of which is recovering from a horrible deprivation inflicted upon themselves due to sudden self awareness and extreme self hatred. And ok fine, it is insanely hard to explain to Soos why Dipper can be found hiding from Mabel in the spare room because he used her hair products and she is out for blood, but otherwise, they're fine.</p>
</div><div class="k31gt">
  <p>No, not at all.</p>
</div><div class="k31gt">
  <p>These people are not fine and no one else in Gravity Falls is.</p>
</div><div class="k31gt">
  <p>Things used to be so much simpler back then, and he spends a good deal of daily time reminiscing.</p>
</div><div class="k31gt">
  <p>But now hes moved on to waiting for Bills inevitable return through the fleshy vessel that was Pacifica, he really can't wait to put a stake through her heart for good. Somedays he does wish his life was normal, other days hes laughing his ass off as his sister records him treating a unicorn like a bucking bronco machine to see how long he lasts.</p>
</div><div class="k31gt">
  <p>But nothing like that is happening to Dipper today, no, instead hes manning the cash register on the only day Soos gets off while Mabel hangs out with Candy and Grenda.</p>
</div><div class="k31gt">
  <p>Normally, he would be fine with this sort of wait, instead he isn't, as he doesn't have any company at all, even the customers are slowly trickling in. He slowly starts to drift off to a half asleep daze, his mind twisting his tired thoughts into horribly dirty things up until the second he snaps awake with a boner and a customer talking to him.</p>
</div><div class="k31gt">
  <p>"Are you awake?" The customer asked, ah, Tak, he momentarily wonders what shes doing here, but he answers either way.</p>
</div><div class="k31gt">
  <p>"Yep, its just been a slow day is all, what can I do for you?" Dipper asked as he straightened his back, tensing when he felt something brush his thigh, he refrained from looking down like an asshole.</p>
</div><div class="k31gt">
  <p>"I was simply wondering how much your finest weapons in this measly crap shack would cost." Tak said, she glanced to the side, must be thinking of Zim again, Dipper can tell by the way her antennae fall from the illusion and twitch, he acts he didn't notice.</p>
</div><div class="k31gt">
  <p>"We don't have any," he starts, freezing and biting his tongue to preventing a small sound from escaping his lips when something palmed his crotch, gripping the zipper, "have any weapons for sale at the moment as Soos confiscated most of them."</p>
</div><div class="k31gt">
  <p>"What a shame," Tak states as though its just a matter of fact, Dipper silently and firmly disagrees with that as he knows it would Weirdmaggedons second coming if she got her hands on a weapon of Gravity Falls, you nearly snort when the heat of whatevers touching you intensifies, you cant refrain an eye twitch and a slight jerk of the elbow, "I was hoping to find a lovely weapon to destroy Zim."</p>
</div><div class="k31gt">
  <p>"Fair enough, is Dib in town?" Dipper asks, hoping dearly that if the Membrane family was in town, Dib wouldn't be trying anything to wacky on the local cryptids, although, his train of thought is torn away rapidly when he feels his balls be gripped by a calloused hand and he nearly squeaks, letting the slightest whimper out when a softer hand gripped the base of his shaft and started sliding back and forth.</p>
</div><div class="k31gt">
  <p>"Hes hanging out with Gaz whose trying so very, very hard to make sure he doesn't do anything insane to Zim or the unicorn he captured." Tak explained to Dipper who listened absentmindedly as the unknown fondler or two under the table delegated pleasure to him, trying to hold focus.</p>
</div><div class="k31gt">
  <p>He was keeping focus perfectly fine up until something wet and warm pressed the tip and ran along the underside of his cock, thats when he froze up. He drew his arms up to his chest in a feverish twitchy manner, and he squeezed his eyes shut as a shudder escaped between his lips. He was worried Tak would notice, but she seemed entirely unfazed at such a sight, he nodded to whatever she said as she kept talking, and the warmth kept caressing.</p>
</div><div class="k31gt">
  <p>"Do you want me to say hi to Dib for you?" Tak asked, raising a brow in a sly manner as she smirked, tapping the counter with her foot.</p>
</div><div class="k31gt">
  <p>"Yes, yes please," Dipper tried to say, but he kept still, perfectly fine up until his balls were squeezed and his cock encased in warmth, he orgasmed just like that with a yelp, Taks smirk grew larger, "say hi to Dib for me."</p>
</div><div class="k31gt">
  <p>"I will, I hope that me coming over made your day just a bit more, oh I don't know, eventful...?" Tak said, although it almost sounded like a question.</p>
</div><div class="k31gt">
  <p>"It's always a joy to see you Tak, a bit of paranormal proof is always lovely to have around," Dipper said, Tak smiled, allowing her disguise to slip, her violet eyes warm with joy, and distinct slyness that Dipper didn't recognize.</p>
</div><div class="k31gt">
  <p>"I'll be on my way now, and tell Dib you say hi," Tak said, turning to leave, "goodbye Dipper, I'll tell him where to find you."</p>
</div><div class="k31gt">
  <p>"Bye Tak," Dipper said as the door swung closed with a jingle of the bell.</p>
</div><div class="k31gt">
  <p>He took a breath as he pushed back his chair, getting ready to look under, and as he did, he found two familiar faces.</p>
</div><div class="k31gt">
  <p>He saw Wendy and Tambry, Wendy had a splotch of thick white on her face Tambry did not. They were both grinning wildly and clearly the ones to blame for his pleasure.</p>
</div><div class="k31gt">
  <p>"Why in the fuck...?" Was all Dipper could get out as Tambry and Wendy started to grin.</p>
</div><div class="k31gt">
  <p>"We thought you were getting a bit bored with your day jobs," Wendy stated, Tambry was pocketing her phone, "so we decided to drop by and say hello."</p>
</div><div class="k31gt">
  <p>"Exactly what she said," Tambry added on, Dipper sighed.</p>
</div><div class="k31gt">
  <p>"Its good to know I wasn't getting sucked off by a gnome," Dipper stated with a bit of a smirk.</p>
</div><div class="k31gt">
  <p>"Good, cause we plan on doing this sometime again."</p>
</div><div class="k31gt">
  <p>"Soon, very soon."</p>

            <p>For as long as you can remember, you haven't been normal, haven't been in the right body, the right spot, the right mind, and neither has your brother.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p> </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>At age thirteen you and your brother finally started to dig around through your inner psyches and try to find out whats hiding deep underneath. Mother doesn't agree with your or your brother trying to find whats lying under the surface, although, he isn't really your brother anymore, and you've swapped names as well.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p> </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>Your Edric now, and shes Emira.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p> </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>And although you still haven't found the magics necessary to finish the transition between your states of existence, that won't stop either of you from trying to find the spell or the glyph. You've both tried everything, you've explored each other one at a time and in sync, and you've decided switching states will help everything make sense.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p> </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>You've talked to Luz, you've talked to Willow, you've even talked to Amity about the spells needed to finish the swap as its happened in times old before the Emperor took over.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p> </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>None of them have managed to find anything, only very, very few fragments of glyphs and words of casting phrases, its not enough.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p> </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>And its really starting to bum the both of you out, sure a nice, hot, bloated squeakbeast resting on your abdomen is soothing when that time of the month rolls around. It still aches and shakes you to your very core every time it happens and blood starts to spill, Emiras always there to comfort you though with a cup of tea and a warm blanket.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p> </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>And now you're both what, nineteen? And neither of you have gotten anywhere in the way of finding out how to finish it, and mother still dislikes it. You're running out of options on an extreme level and the only person left to turn to is Gus, the illusionist, so that's why you've decided to make your way to see him.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p> </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>So there you are, out in public and your chest is aching, you've been wearing extremely tight layers underneath your tunic day in and day out after puberty finished and bolstered your chest. Emiras in a similar situation with impossibly tight shorts on underneath her regular shorts. Her gait is a little bit unstable and your arms are locked across your chest as you make your way to Gus's Illusory Stand to try and get some hardcore illusions, stronger than the ones Emira uses to give her chest a bit of illusory oomph.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p> </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>You speak first as Gus waves you over.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p> </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>"Hey Gus," you start, forcing your pitch awry, you forget to cast the voice morpher this morning, he grins, "we got some questions."</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p> </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>"Is it about the noodle incident, theres no proof I did it!" Gus snapped out of instinct, it caused you and Emira to flinch back before he chuckled awkwardly, realizing the noodle incident hasn't made it that far out of the social ring yet.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p> </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>"Whats the noodle incident?" Emira asked, grinning a little bit.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p> </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>"Uh, never mind, never mind," Gus said nervously, waving his hands a little bit to try and distract, "so, what can I do you for in the world of illusions and mischief?"</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p> </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>"Gus, you remember when the blight twins specialized in opposite magics correct?" Emira asked gently, swiftly as well, trying not to spill to much.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p> </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>"Of course I do, I'll never forget when you, Emira, specialized in beasts, and Edric, specialized in healing, man, you guys have changed so much since you were thirteen, of course, you were just Hexsides best at that times, so I never knew you personally, but I'm assuming that you've changed," Gus said, he took note of you and Emiras reactions with extreme intent, "of course, maybe you haven't switched magic, and something else has?"</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p> </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>"Ding, ding, ding, correct, we have changed," you said, you slowly lowered your arms from your chest, Gus's eyes widened when the pieces clicked, "and we require your best illusions, be it glyphs or spells, we need help."</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p> </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>"isn't using that magic forbidden," Gus asked, both you and Emira glanced to each other, "and more importantly, isn't Edric set to become the head of the illusion coven one day?"</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p> </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>"Yes, yes I am, but its a risk I'm willing to take," you say, you respond to fast for it to be natural, "besides, it was Emira who was predicted to become head of coven, I'm just stealing her thunder now."</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p> </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>"Look, I have a few glyphs and phrases you can use, but they'll only stay permanent so long as you focus on the fact its in action, as long as you can remember and know its an illusion, they'll be physical and eventually the effects will become permanent," Gus explained, seemingly anxious at the idea, he pulled out a small pad of paper with a bunch of words and titles on them, it was in code full of symbols and numerals you didn't have the patience to decipher, were they curses?</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p> </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>"Perfect, how much will it cost us?" Emira asked, already cutting to chase, she scared you sometimes with how swift her decisions were.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p> </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>"Take it, I've been plagued with these... Savage Magics for to long, just remember one thing," Gus said as he reached under the stall and pulled out a small box, he marked something as sold on the piece of paper before handing you the box, "you didn't get this from me."</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p> </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>Both you and Emira nodded before you gripped the box, it wasn't heavy, it felt hollow, and the carvings had glyphs you had never seen before, and a scratched out coven sigil. You gave a prompt thanks to Gus before taking your leave with Emira. Your grip on the box tightened as your paces picked up, you two only had, four to five hours before Amity returned and three days until mother returned from her vacation.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p> </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>When you finally made it back home, the door was slammed shut behind both of you and you could hear jingling of bells hooked on the handle so it would be known if someone entered. Your breathing was heavy, Emira was fine, she always was, your grip on the box was shaking as you slid down the door, your heart pounding and mind racing. Emira sat down beside you and placed a hand on your shaking shoulder, you snapped to look at her, her expression was soft and her hair askew just a bit, you calmed instantly.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p> </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>You took a deep, shaky breath as you cracked open the box, being greeted with glyphs drawn onto pieces of paper and a phrases on a few other pieces of paper.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p> </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>"How, how do you think we should do this?" You ask, turning to Emira for advice, she simply stands and holds out a hand, you close the box and take her hand before standing beside her.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p> </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>"How we always discover, Ed, how else?" She asked gently before leading you across the living room up a set of stairs to your shared room, Amity got one of her own, you found it rather unfair that you and Emira had to share, but it did prevent a lot of walking on creaky floors at night if you had to talk or coexist.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p> </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>"Good point," you responded with calmly as she clicked the door shut behind you, disarming the illusion on her chest and reaching to pull her tunics off as you sat down, shedding your pants and one of your tunics as well, she joins you shortly, "so, how do you think this stuff even works?"</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p> </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>"Whenever Luz uses her glyphs she places them on the ground and the magic forms from there, so maybe we just..." Emira started as she reached for a glyph and placed it on her bare chest, tapping the paper again as she focused on what she wanted to come to, and slowly but surely her breasts formed in pliant and cushy patches of flesh, they weren't bountiful like Odalias, but, it was still different.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p> </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>Her expression was shocked as she gently prodded one, she nearly winced, sensitive, but it felt good, as she kept going for more. You simply stared before yanking off your own tunics and placing a glyph on your chest, directly between both of your breasts, and you imagined it so, so hard and you felt them shrink down. It was a little bit painful as they retreated into your chest, and you didn't exactly get rock hard pectoral muscles, but it wasn't titties anymore which was pleasant, your posture straightened right away.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p> </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>"Ed," Emira began shakily as she reached for another glyph, her breasts bolstering in size again, you could hear her shudder of relief as they stretched skin, "Are, are they always this sensitive?"</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p> </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>"I see you're enjoying tits, you're gonna have to start wearing a bra-aah," you say in a sing song voice with a shit eating grin, all to aware Emiras going to hate it despite never wearing a bra before, Emira glares at you and you can't help your grin dipping into a smirk.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p> </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>"Am not," she says with spite lacing her voice, crossing her legs, you let your eyes linger on her crotch, she notices and her face starts to burn up.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p> </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>"We're nineteen and you still don't know what keeps tits looking perky?" You ask in an almost joking manner, the way she glances to the ground tells you that you guessed right, "Damn, you really did stay sheltered, you ever heard of the internet, that we and all of the realm have had access to ever since the rip between realms happened?"</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p> </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>"Well, I mean, of course I have, I just, didn't do to much digging, thats all," Emira says nervously, reaching for another glyph, you stop her, she stares at you.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p> </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>"Anything larger than that and your back will kill you," you warn, she nods before slipping off her shorts, and you were correct, she is horny, "do you want to, use it one last time before you'll never be able to again?"</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p> </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>She nods rapidly and you take a deep breath before sliding out of your damp panties and leaning against the edge of your bed, knees up. You slowly unhitch your legs and spread them until theirs a slight burn of a stretch at your inner thighs, your sex is revealed, and its practically glistening in the light with how wet you are. Your face starts to heat up when you notice that Emiras staring, you groan before burying it in your arms, you hear a faint shuffle and your head is tilted up and another head is pressed to your entrance.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p> </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>"Its ok," is what Emira murmured to you before slowly lowering her hips, and even though the two of you have done this so many times now, it still stings and you still tense with every inch until shes hilted.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p> </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>She slowly started to roll her hips, grinding into you before she started to pull out just a bit with the way she rolled her hips. Soft mewls started to pour past your lips as her momentum slowly picked up, you can't help but admire what an amazing sister she is. Soon enough she hammering into you, and few moans escape your lips due to five years of having to repress them, you reach for her hair. Slowly you undo her braid, untying the strands until a waterfall of green billows past her shoulders, you grip onto her back, nails digging into skin.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p> </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>"You can be loud for me," Emira whispered into your ear, you shuddered and you felt yourself lurch ever closer to the edge, "its just you and me."</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p> </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>She hits a particularly good spot shes only hit once before and you fucking scream, stars cloud up your vision and tears well in your eyes. She keeps hitting it over and over and your screams turn into languid moans you're sure echo between hallways. If Amity comes home to this, you don't even want to think about such things, so you simply close your eyes only for them to snap right on open when a flood fills your womb followed by a moan on either side as you to hit peak.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p> </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>Emira falls back off of you, heaving a few deep breaths, unlike her, you're ready for round two in a matter of seconds. A few minutes pass and shes sipping on a bottle of water you keep hidden under your bed for if you wake up thirsty. Your sitting behind her and keeping your arms wrapped around her chest, squeezing and caressing her chest, you know its affecting her.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p> </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>"Alright," Emira starts as she screws the cap back onto the water bottle and places it to the side, "time for the main event."</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p> </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>"Agreed," you say as you each grab a gylph, you hesitate before speaking, "you first."</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p> </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>"Pussy," Emira says with a smirk as she places the glyph at the base of her shaft.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p> </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>"Your gonna have one soon," you respond with as you watch her cock shrink into her body, and momentarily its just flat before a slit starts to form and either half puffs a little until she has a pussy, or a pretty damn good replica of one with little external flaws.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p> </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>"Now you," she says cockily, refraining from fingering herself just yet.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p> </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>"Dick," you mutter as you place the glyph right above the tip of the slit, this glyph is different though, the ink is purple, Emiras were pink and your other one was blue, you doubt it'll make a difference.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p> </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>"Your gonna have one soon," she responds with as she watches your nub of a clitoris slowly poke past your lower lips until you've gained almost a dick, its just, off.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p> </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>You and Emira stare at what you conjured in confusion, as you still have a hole beneath it. It ain't exactly witch dick or human dick, its a lot more slimy, and getting slimier. You go to prod and it writhes before curling against your finger without you even thinking. Its like it has a mind of its own in a freakish sense, maybe when you're done using it the hole will disappear and it'll be a regular cock...?</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p> </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>"What in the name of fucking Titan is that?" Emira asked as the tentacle protruding from your crotch released your finger and started writhing about.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p> </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>"I don't know, maybe I wasn't focusing enough," you say, desperately grasping for straws to explain the purple toned tentacle dick writhing and oozing an odd substance, and with an immense amount of urgency you add, "or, or, please tell me we have more glyphs?"</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p> </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>"Hopefully," Emira says in a doubtful tone, you start to panic and she sidles over to you and wraps an arm around your shoulders, you can hear your heartbeat thundering in your chest, "don't worry, I know a few demons who have items just like it."</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p> </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>"You, you fucked a demon?" You ask shakily, you sniffle a bit as well, she only nods.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p> </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>"Of course I have, now," Emira says before sitting in front of you on her knees, she places your hands in hers, "do you want to use it?"</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p> </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>"Yeah, only if you do." You say, you're getting all sappy on her and even though you aware the tentabulge is searching for her clit, you feel rather emotional.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p> </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>"Of course I do, so fuck me, brother." She says before leaning into you, spreading your legs a little bit as she does, and your dick scopes out her entrance stat and plunges in just like so, her eyes snap open and a moan comes out.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p> </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>You slowly rock your hips and lean against her, the sensation of just how deep your getting with this thing is mind boggling. Even though you can't control it, you and Emira are both loving it, even with purple slicking the carpet below you. Its only a matter of minutes till she pressed against you and your slamming into her, your dick digging into a new soft spot each time, and each time she cries out. Eventually, you can't pull out, and the tentacle has latched onto something, you still grind against her and fondle her breasts, her moans don't stop.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p> </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>Soon enough, a scream tears through her as the entirety of your tentacle expelled a gush of material that causes her abdomen to bloat just a bit. You still can't move, but you can feel, you can feel something start to shift from the pit of your stomach to the base of your dick. Its ovular, and its hard as it tries to force through Emiras entrance till it pops through. She groans in pain as a second and third do the same, it takes you a few seconds of looking at the subtle lumps on her stomach that they're eggs. You can move again, and you do, you pull out as the tentacle retreats back into your crotch leaving a sheath in its place, you're perplexed.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p> </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>Once post nut clarity wears off you realize just what it is you've done.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p> </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>You came inside of Emira and laid eggs inside as well.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p> </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>You bred your sister and turned her into an incubator.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p> </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>Fuck, it isn't even a normal dick you used, even if the eggs you laid hatch you're probably gonna get quarterling mutants. You glance at her entrance and see its slick with the purple you pumped her full of, oh Titan, was she using a protection spell? Would a protection spell work? Does she even know any protection spells? You're usually the one whose using them so mothers best and only son doesn't get pregnant, but Emira, oh no, no, no, no-</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p> </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>You freeze up when a hand is placed on your shoulder, you snap your head to glare at whoever put it their, your gaze softens when you see its Emira. She looks dazed and she reaches down to grab a small bit of the viscous fluid before tasting it. You take a few deep breathes as she rubs your back, your eyes are closed and you're beyond glad mother isn't home.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p> </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>"Edric, that was amazing-"</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p> </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>"Please tell me you know a protection spell?"</p>
          </div>

            <p>Having a quirk like hers, it only makes sense that aspiring hero Tsuyu Asui has some extra hurdles to living normally.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p> </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>She can't go for long periods without water, her speech is impeded by keros occasionally and worst of all is her heat.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p> </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>Whenever a deep urge to find and fuck someone or something takes over bit by bit, she usually has a few hours to find a quiet space to wait things out in. When she was accepted into UA, she was filled with a sense of dread and excitement, as a few months beforehand, she had finished her first heat and feared it would happen during school hours. She brought this up with her parents who agreed to speak with the principal about it sometime before school started.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p> </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>"Next." A voice stated calmly from outside the office where Tsuyu and her parents sat, she was practically shaking, fingernails digging into her palms, she looked up and saw a parent and a blonde kid with golden who gave a reaffirming smile her way.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p> </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>"Don't worry, hes really nice," the kid said, Tsuyu nodded looking up, she stood after her parents did. "I'm Denki, I hope we see each other in class."</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p> </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>"Yeah, kero." Tsuyu said as she entered the office, staring at the floor.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p> </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>"Mr and Ms Asui, what seems to be the problem, or more accurately the concern?" Nezu stated calmly.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p> </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>"Well, you see principal Nezu, our daughter has started going into heat," her mother said, Tsuyu nodded shamefully, she loved her quirk and how physical it was, but this was a downside she hated. "And we don't quite know all the tells yet, but if possible could you set her up with a student to let her know until she can notice on her own, that blonde boy-"</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p> </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>"Denki." Tsuyu interrupts.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p> </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>"Yes, Denki seemed rather friendly." Her mother finished, no doubt sending her a glare.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p> </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>"I used to struggle all the time with that, I found some represents though, but if you don't want her on represents I completely understand," Nezu said. "And your idea also sounds great."</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p> </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>"Do you think medications will help?" Her father asked.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p> </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>"No, I kind of want to figure it out, kero, so if I stopped represents I would know the signs." Tsuyu answered with as she looked up, easing when she saw Nezu had an animal quirk as well, it helped her feel much safer.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p> </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>"I respect and understand that perfectly, I can tell the teachers in advance about the conundrum we have and let them know you may have to drop out of class on account of it," Nezu said as he pulled up an email, adding all the teachers plus a few good substitutes to the address list. "If it hits a point where you need someone else, tell the teacher and ask if someone can come with you."</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p> </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>"Alright." Tsuyu said, hoping that wouldn't happen for a few more years at least.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p> </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>"And I don't want to sound like a cliche, but I get it, and once we figure out the signs we can bend your curriculum a bit to try and help with that balance." Nezu said, Tsuyu nodded gently, the fact she was impeding on his life with her problems bugged her to an extreme extent, but he was a principal, tons of kids had accommodations to be met, hopefully.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p> </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>The first heat during the school year was in the first month, and Denki had been assigned to try and notice, and he did a good job. He took note of irregular headaches throughout the day, what appeared to be severe dehydration and her raised body heat. He brought it up to Aizawa during break and he helped Tsuyu, who was stumbling a bit at this point, to her dorm before setting her up with some water.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p> </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>Denki left to return to class only to be sent right back to her dorm, Aizawa refusing to let her be left unsupervised in a semi delirious state. The rest of the class still had no clue at this point, and she wanted it to stay that way forever, she knew it wouldn't, but she could try. And so Denki hung around for the following three days, bringing her food and water and making sure she didn't trigger vomiting by moving to swiftly.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p> </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>Those three days went shockingly smooth and nothing bad happened up until Denki was confronted by Bakugou who was desperate to know what was happening. Now, Bakugou was wise cornering Denki over Tsuyu, where Tsuyu would be unshakable in keeping her truths secret, Denki crumbled under his glaring red eyes. He spilled it in seconds in the final stall of the washroom furthest from the door, he was sure someone else heard and that Tsuyu would have his head for it. But at the end of it all he was begging on his hands knees for Bakugou to not tell anyone at all about what was said, and he didn't.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p> </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <div class="k31gt">
              <p>It was the eighteenth of October when Tsuyus heat decided to hit her again, a sharp tingling in her loins and she squirmed. The class was still going on and on, but she could feel signs of a state of delirium start to show. She gingerly raised her hand and Aizawa stopped speaking.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="k31gt">
              <p>"Yes, Asui, what seems to be the problem?" Aizawa asked sternly, his gaze sharp until it softened when she saw her condition.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="k31gt">
              <p>"I need to take a break, kero, I'm feeling 'sick' right now," Tsuyu said, lying to the rest of her class, but Nezu had made sure Aizawa knew that was the code.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="k31gt">
              <p>"How bad is it and whose allowed to come help you?" Aizawa asked, now Denki was catching on, a look of slight concern on his face as Tsuyu walked up.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="k31gt">
              <p>"Really bad," she whispered, cupping her hands around her mouth so the class couldn't hear, "Ochaco and Izuku can help."</p>
            </div>
            <div class="k31gt">
              <p>"Understood, you're dismissed," Aizawa said Tsuyu went to leave before he spoke again, "Kaminari, make sure she has a cup of water before returning."</p>
            </div>
            <div class="k31gt">
              <p>Denki nodded as he stood up and followed Tsuyu through the halls, her dorm was furthest from the class, and by the time they reached it she was stumbling and Denki had to help her balance. She staggered to her bed, refraining from shedding her clothing just yet while Denki poured her a cup of water. He sat on the edge of the bed, handing her the water which she slowly sipped, her body was starting to heat up.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="k31gt">
              <p>"Don't do to much," Denki said before taking his leave, not wanting to risk losing his respect with Tsuyu for invading her space.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="k31gt">
              <p>On the way back to class though, he found Izuku and Ochaco heading down to Tsuyus room. Protective panic spiked and he started a small conversation with them.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="k31gt">
              <p>"Hey, what're you doing over here, isn't class still in sesh?" Denki asked, quirking a brow in an innocent manner, Izuku was furiously blushing and Ochaco was the one to answer.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="k31gt">
              <p>"Sensei Aizawa sent us to take care of her while she's 'sick' for the next day or so," Ochaco said, putting a specific emphasis on sick that Denki could pick up.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="k31gt">
              <p>"Cut the lingo, he sent you to fuck her, didn't he?" Denki asked his tone was sharp as a knife and static started skip across his skin.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="k31gt">
              <p>"Pretty crass, but yes, thats what he said," Izuku answered quietly, his voice a stammer, Denki took a few deep breaths to steady his composure again before speaking.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="k31gt">
              <p>"Look, just don't take advantage of her, and make sure she stays hydrated, her body doesn't react nicely to overheating and she burns through water fast," Denki said, forcing eye contact with Ochaco and Izuku for a second or two before leaving to the class.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="k31gt">
              <p>The two gently nudged open Tsuyus door, even in the quaint four minutes between them and Denki she was already naked and wrapped in a damp towel to stay cold. Her entire body was hot, practically steaming, slick oozed from between her thighs, dripping down and staining her legs and sheets. She was shaking and sipping a cup of water, she barely registered Izuku and Ochaco as she put down her and lied down on her back.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="k31gt">
              <p>This, for Izuku at least, was a turn of immense proportions, he was getting horny just at the sight. Ochaco on the other hand, was a little bit less aroused, but still getting wet at the long croaking moan Tsuyu released.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="k31gt">
              <p>"Dibs pussy," was all Izuku said while shedding his shirt and trying to kick off his pants, it took Ochaco a second for the words to register until she too dashed over.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="k31gt">
              <p>"Dibs tits," was what Ochaco said as she slipped out of her skirt and undid the buttons of her shirt, sliding onto the bed beside Tsuyu and gripping her breasts.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="k31gt">
              <p>Tsuyu gave a soft moan as Ochaco massaged her breasts, it felt like shes had years of experience. She slowly outstretched an arm, sliding her fingers along Ochacos inner thighs, Ochaco shivering as she did. A singular finger pressed to her clit and Ochaco tensed, squeezing Tsuyus breasts tight, eliciting a moan from both parties.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="k31gt">
              <p>Izuku was slow as he lined himself up, gently pressing the tip to Tsuyus entrance until he eased in. Tsuyu was wet, and just lax to the max, she moaned as her insides gave way to Izuku. He slowly started rolling his hips, pressing his hands to her hips, she looked amazing, and the massage Ochaco was ministering only made things look better.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="k31gt">
              <p>The only thing such a sight was lacking is the fact shes leaking his cum and pregnant, but hes going to change that.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="k31gt">
              <p>He starts thrusting faster, his pace picking up detrimentally so, their pelvises smash together and she clenches her fingers, rubbing Ochacos sweet spot. She nearly orgasms on the spot, but holds out, keeps on holding out until shes sure Izuku is about to blow his load.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="k31gt">
              <p>Tsuyu is currently in ecstasy, her tongue lolling out as she pants and moans out croaks and ribbits. Her voice is constantly hitting and higher and higher in pitch as Izuku pushes her cervix with each thrust. When he breaks the barrier she hits her orgasm, so does Ochaco, coating Tsuyus hand in white stickiness, Izuku comes last, groaning as he does, but he holds still, determined to make sure she stays bred.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="k31gt">
              <p>Afterglow is quaint and Tsuyu realizes shes dehydrated before reaching for water, Ochaco hands it to her, shaking slightly. As Tsuyu sips the water slowly, Izuku collapses on top of her still grinding incessantly. He still has an erection, but he can't risk pulling out to far, otherwise she might not be bred, so he grinds and grinds until he comes again and hes satisfied.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="k31gt">
              <p>Tsuyu hands her glass of water to Ochaco who puts it on the night table before she lies down, Ochaco sliding her hand between Izukus abdomen and hers.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="k31gt">
              <p>They all pass out in that position, satisfied and without a care.</p>
            </div>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>Turns that Davesprite can purr.</p><p>It just started happening one day in the midst of a small session you and him had.</p><p>A loud rumbling emitted from his chest and he was purring.</p><p>Its been really, really awkward in the Strider household since that point.</p><p>It didn't even make sense!</p><p>Davesprite was prototyped with a fucking dead bird not a dead cat!</p><p>You still planned on confronting him about it though.</p><p>You slid up next to Davesprite, both Bro and Delta had left for work and Dirk was taking skateboard lessons. He was somewhat sitting on the couch, although the tail that being a sprite promised made it awkward for him. You were on side of the couch and he was sliding away from you, staring directly at the TV which wasn't even on.</p><p>"So," you began, Davesprite tensed unnoticeably to the untrained eye, the way his tail twitched was a telltale sign, "you can purr like a cat."</p><p>"What about it?" Davesprite asked cautiously, aware you were the only who knew.</p><p>"Its like, really cute man," you said, somewhat tense as you rubbed the back of your neck, Davesprite calmed instantly.</p><p>"Oh thank fucking god, I was worried you would stop liking me because of it," Davesprite said, words coming out in a vomit as his orange wings fanned out and dragged you in close enough for a hug causing you to tense slightly.</p><p>"I would never, I love you," you said, wrapping your arms around Davesprite, one hand pressing into the hole in his chest, he shivered as his wings twitched.</p><p>"How much?" Davesprite asked, you stared up at before pressing fingers into his damp chest hole, the linings slimy and warm, oozing an orange fluid as you split it open.</p><p>"I love you to the point I have let you use me until I can't move in the morning, I love you to the point where I would do a few strifes with Bro for you, I love you so fucking much Davesprite that I would probably take an absurd amount of bullets for you," you said, opening up your heart to him and a few orange tinted tears slid past his shades, you continued as you slid your entire hand into his chest, he gave a groan, "fuck man, I even helped patch you up after Delta had a turn with you."</p><p>"Aw, Dave," Davesprite said, he sounded so damn heartfelt as those words involuntarily spilled out of you, you stared back to the TV with a quick movement, realizing how exposed you now were.</p><p>"Of course, we don't have to keep being there for each other all the time if you don't want to," you said, mentally slapping yourself as you realized the stupid words coming from your mouth, you don't want to give up Davesprite.</p><p>You love him.</p><p>You love him so fucking much.</p><p>"No, no Dave, I always want to be at your side man, I'm ride or die you know, and we ride," Davesprite said, you were both aware things were getting a bit to fluffy so you squirmed your fingers inside his chest, he gave a shaky moan, "we ride in many ways."</p><p>"Good, cause I've wanted to give this hole another try for ever," you said as you yanked off your pants, Davesprite already removing your hand and spreading his gaping chest as you climbed on top of him.</p><p>"Perfect, cause its rather worthless without a sword inside," Davesprite said, smirking as you slowly sunk into him, cock nearly poking out the other side, he gave a long moan.</p><p>"Awesome, cause I have one here thats ready to be sheathed again," you replied with as you rolled your hips, gripping his shoulders as his wings fanned out and shook slightly, releasing pheromones as orange feathers fell down.</p><p>"Lit, cause this bird is feeling like an empty sheath without your sword," Davesprite answered with as he wrapped his tail around your ass and squeezed, eliciting a soft moan.</p><p>"Gnarly, cause I love it when my baby bird purrs just for me," you responded with, he smirked up at you before digging talons into your waist and pressing a love bite to your chest.</p><p>The amount of orange spilling from Davesprites chest was impossible as you thrusted in and out back and forth. You gripped his shoulders, your position on the couch very awkward but you kept at it. He was a moaning mess under you, his chest innately sensitive on the inside a you brushed against where organs once were.</p><p>The tail squeezing your ass was a distraction you coped with as you hit a stalemate with your balls, your body refusing to cum. You only went faster in response, tugging on Davesprites wings and panting as pheromones were breathed in. Davesprite was grinning and you didn't seem to notice until something plunged into your ass.</p><p>His tail.</p><p>About six inches of writhing mass assaulting your prostate.</p><p>That had you shrieking as you hit the peak, orange mixed with white in his chest and he moaned.</p><p>You slumped against him and slid down and out until you were in his lap, his tail removed as well. You were still panting and only then did you hear the soft vibrations in his chest. It slowly got louder and louder until you could feel it vibrating in your bones and shaking your organs. A set of neon orange wings wrapped around you partially and you could see the smug look on Davesprites face.</p><p>"So," he began, "you can pant like a dog?"</p><p>"Yeah, what about it?" You snapped at him, out of breath.</p><p>"I'm just thinking, if Dirk doesn't mind, we should borrow some of his things for a night," Davesprite said, the fact he wanted you to be a dog for him suddenly clicked.</p><p>"I'm not gonna be your fucking dog, Davesprite," you said with a long groan as you pressed your head against his shoulders.</p><p>"Not even for a scooby snack?" Davesprite asked smugly as he ran talons across your back slowly as to not tear skin.</p><p>"No Davesprite," you began before biting down hard, your teeth sinking into his inhuman flesh as he moaned out in a languid tone, throwing his head back a bit as you put and more and more marks on him, "not even for a scooby snack." <a rel="nofollow"></a></p>

  <p>"Ash, I wouldn't suggest touching that," Gary said as Ash stared in awe at the gray-purple stone, it had white stripes and it almost seemed to glow despite being covered in dust.</p><p>"C'mon Gary, what kind of consequences could there be, you <em>are</em> the scientist in this partnership, so tell me," Ash said as he reached for the stone, Gary pausing for a second before responding.</p><p>"Well, it could cause an infection, a horrible mind melting illness, a deathly allergic reaction, it could do nothing at all, Ash, I would not suggest risking it though," Gary said, crossing his arms over his lab coat as his friend reached for the item.</p><p>Jesse and James had sent them looking for it, as Meowth was ill and needed sleep to recover. Truth be told, Team Rocket had semi disbanded and Jesse and James turned to Gary and Ash for some type of support. The two agreed upon letting them live in the shed until they could find sustainable jobs, it had been a week or two now and to make matters worse it was nice. The Pokemon got guaranteed training on both ends, and neither party wanted that to be lost.</p><p>Eventually though, they had a request of Ash and Gary.</p><p>And it was to find this specific stone, their last Team Rocket mission and they wanted to find it for closure, but alas, Meowth was sick.</p><p>"Relax, it's fine, see?" Ash said as he held up the rock with a grin, Gary only glared at him.</p><p>"It's kind of dusty, don't you think, Ashie?" Gary asked with a bit of a smirk as he walked over to Ash, the latter flustered at the nickname.</p><p>"Yeah, yeah, I just yanked it out of the dirt, relax, I'll clean it off," Ash said before rubbing away the dust with the palm of his hand, he wasn't wearing his gloves today.</p><p>As he rubbed the stone clean, it started to glow brighter, brighter and brighter in a purple glow that enveloped. That had Garys inner scientist freaking the fuck out and jumping away while Ash was frozen in shock. He didn't move even as the now white glow started to coat his form and change it, shrinking him down.</p><p>Now, it didn't hurt necessarily.</p><p>But when Ash could see again, all he saw was Garys shins, and then a pair of paws when he looked down. He, he was not himself anymore, he got changed in the body, completely. He had giant ears on his head and it threw off his balance and his nose was hyper sensitive, was, was he a Meowth?</p><p>"Holy fuck Ashie, you, you're a Purugly," Gary said, covering his mouth with his hands, Ash heard the gasp and started to freak out, the tail on his waist tightening until he forcibly relaxed it.</p><p>"I'm a what?" Ash asked as he forced himself onto his hinds to be able to see past the waist of Garys pants, and then Gary crouched down next to him, grinning gleefully, Ash looked so adorable.</p><p>"A Purugly, a cute little kitty, with a fat fucking booty, Meowth is gonna have a field day with this," Gary said as he reached to pick up Ash who struggled momentarily his grasp, Gary had to heave just a bit as he lifted up Ash, having a hard time doing so, "and look, I was right, there was a side effect."</p><p>"Shut up, it didn't take effect until after a minute, so you could've been wrong!" Ash snapped as his tail gripped onto Garys arm, Gary was still grinning as he carried Ash home.</p><p>"Your wrong, I <em>am</em> the scientist after all, so I should be right ninety five percent of the time," Gary said, Ash started to growl and Gary started to scratch behind his left ear and Ash was purring in a second.</p><p>When Gary and Ash returned they found Team Rocket in the house and Meowth was sitting in his catbed, snoring away. James was cooking, humming to himself happily as he did so, Jesse was gossiping while James nodded along. It was an odd sight, but a nice one indeed, seeing them all so domestic and docile had both Gary and Ash shocked but the scent of the food was delectable.</p><p>"Yo, we're home," Gary said, knocking on the door frame, Jesse and James snapped to look at the two of you, Meowth stayed sleeping, both J's stopped what they were doing, "you can keep cooking, it smells great.</p><p>"Ah, I was hoping this would end up a surprise for you two being so nice to us," James said as he worked on the small meal again, Jesse started to talk to James once again.</p><p>"What's up with Meowth, most of the time he's up and at 'em even if he's sick?" Ash asked, both Team Rocket veterans stood still in shock at the familiar voice coming from the Purugly.</p><p>"Um, why doe that Purugly sound like Ash?" Jesse asked, quirking a died hot pink brow.</p><p>"That stone you wanted, yeah, it turned Ash into this," Gary said as he lowered down Ash who was very, very quick to skitter off and hop onto the couch, a small amount of heat gathering in his lower stomach, he ached, "now, about Meowth and why you couldn't find that stone yourself?"</p><p>"Meowth is in a rut right now, you're a scientist, so you already know what that means, I hope at least?" James explained, Gary looked almost disgusted at that notion, but when he looked to Meowth, he found the subtle signs there, he was twitching a bit, seemed to be shifting in sleep.</p><p>"Yes I know exactly what that word means, James, now he won't try anything on Ashie, right?" Gary asked, Ashs ears perked up a bit at the mention of his name, it was different, being so acute with hearing, the heat in his lower half did not cease regardless.</p><p>"So long as Ash doesn't enter heat, which he shouldn't be able to do so as a guy, Meowth won't find any attraction at all towards Ash, attraction of wanting to breed him at least," James explained to Gary, Ash listened to each word carefully, right, he is a guy, he'll be fine, "I hope that Meowth doesn't have an interspecies kink, for Ashes sake."</p><p>"Yeah, me to," Gary said bitterly as he pulled off his lab coat, wearing not but a skin tight, collared, black top underneath it, he gets to warm while wearing sleeves underneath, "I have to go do some sciencey work you wouldn't understand don't bother me, and you two, three actually."</p><p>Jesse and James met Garys almost glaring gaze nervously.</p><p>"Spare rooms all yours, only, because you cooked food," Gary said before grabbing the plate James finished filling with eggs, he grabbed a fork on the way to his room.</p><p>By the time midnight rolled around Ash was panicking, cause holy fuck, since when did he have a vagina? Since when he was female? What in the FUCK is going on?!</p><p>Right, Purugly now.</p><p>That still didn't calm him down as the heat bubbling up refused to quiet down no matter how hard he, no, she tried to quiet it. She tried and tried but failed each and every time, she was in heat, what else, she had read about it in books. But Ash Ketchum of Pallet Town, in heat, a Purugly no less, what a fucking night. And didn't Jesse and James say that Meowth is in a rut, recalling fifth grade Pokeology, wherein he learned about rut and heat.</p><p>Rut happens to male Pokemon, it puts them in a fertilizing state where they wish to find a mate.</p><p>Heat happens to a female Pokemon, it puts them in a fertile state where they wish to find a mate.</p><p>It took her a few seconds for it to click in her head, and then panic doubled over, a surge of heat coiling in her stomach. She gave a weak mewl of needing as she sprawled herself across the couch she lay on top of, she didn't have the patience to move to her room. Meowth was still asleep in his catbed on top of the counter, he had slept the day away, commonly awake at night.</p><p>And he was in a rut.</p><p>Lovely, Ash hoped he wouldn't be in the mood for breeding.</p><p>A loud yawn sounded, followed by clinking of claws on a marbled counter and Ash knew Meowth was up. He slowly hopped down, blinking his eyes open before taking a few deep breathes, eyes snapping wide open. He smelt it on the air, such a fine scent of another feline Pokemon, one female, one in heat, a boner started to come through.</p><p>"I wonder who could be making such a lovely scent?" Meowth called out, pupils slitting into ones much more feral as he walked along the hardwood floors, claws clicking so loud in Ashes ears.</p><p>And as he rounded the couch Ash tensed and pounced out of reflex, hissing and clawing at the Meowth who kicked off the Purugly with ease. Meowth pounced back, keeping the Purugly pinned, the purple felines fur damp and opening coming clear. Meowth crooned and nuzzled against Ash who was panicking, what a way to lose her virginity, what a way.</p><p>"Wait! Meowth, don't," Ash pleaded, the tone had Meowth shook up and pausing his advances, standing up and allowing Ash to do the same.</p><p>"But you're in heat, Ashie, wouldn't you love it if that heat just, went away with a bit of a helping paw?" Meowth said, giving Ash a questioning look that had Ash blushing, she hadn't realized that just, doing it would fix the heat.</p><p>"How much would it help?" Ash asked, she was skeptical.</p><p>"Well, the thing is that it would help both of us, and a new species would come out of our crossbreeding, an adorable one I'm entirely sure of Ash, so, do you want a paw through it?" Meowth asked once again, nuzzling up to Ash a bit, pupils starting to slit once more, but this time he knew the one, so he knew to be easier, gentler even.</p><p>"Fine, go for it, make sure you get it right the first time though," Ash said, she was starting to get impatient already, and only for a split second did she catch the toothy grin Meowth before being mounted.</p><p>Ashes eyes shot open, a yowl partially escaped her lips until Meowth covered her mouth, claws dragging through fur as a warning. For a few moments did they sit their without movement until Meowth started to move, rolling his hips back and forth and Ash struggled to stay silent. Her body ached, being in heat was definitely helping her case a lot, but it was still an uncomfortable stretch as Meowth started to thrust.</p><p>Eventually what could've been deemed as yowls turned into moaning mewls as she adapted and Meowths pupils slit as pheromones clouded his mind more and more. It was rough, it was hot, there was fur and claws, and Ash was beyond ecstasy, maybe she could stay like this for a while. Wave after wave of heat washed over her form as her legs fell out beneath her, eyes started to flutter shut, she could just fall asleep, this was all to much.</p><p>And the Meowth came, knot slipping past and keeping her held still as her eyes snapped open once again.</p><p>Meowth pulled her down to lay on her side, she followed and Meowth started  nuzzling and purring against her as she tried to move. She couldn't though, stuck in place on Meowths knot, what a way to lose ones virginity for the second time. Eventually, with Meowths paws wrapped around her center, she drifted off to sleep, not even afraid of what was next to come.</p><p>The morning came and Meowth was sitting on the counter, poised perfectly for when Jesse and James emerged, while Ash was destroyed. Her fur was askew and she felt torn up on the inside, but the patch of fur below was cleaned of any evidence, which was thoughtful of Meowth.</p><p>James came out first, finding that Meowth looked rather chipper. He started making breakfast before speaking.</p><p>"What has you so chipper, Meowth?" James asked as he pulled down a bowl and grabbed a pan, placing it on the heating element.</p><p>"Oh nothing much, I just had a good sleep is all, I'm sure Ash did to, right Ash?" Meowth asked, unable to help a smirk, Ash gave a groan in response, asshole.</p><p>"Good for you, and your rut, is that almost over?" James asked, Meowth had almost completely forgotten about yesterdays predicament involving his rut.</p><p>"No, but I'll be fine," Meowth said before hopping off the counter and making his way to Ash, curling up against the Purugly who edged away.</p><p>"Good, cause we have to go on a shopping trip today to get some more food," James said as he slid butter into the pan.</p><p>"Are you sure that I can't stay home and take care of Ash, it must be hard being a Pokemon so suddenly," Meowth said, he was lying only a bit, he just wanted to make sure Ash would be fine through it.</p><p>"I suppose so," James said, dropping a few pieces of bacon into the pan it sizzled and the scent started to waft.</p><p>The following months passed and it became very, very apparent something was wrong with Ash. She was getting larger and ate more than usual as well, her mood getting a bit snippy as well. Gary knew exactly what was wrong, and was going to punch his friend when they found a way to turn him back.</p><p>Ash was pregnant, and he, she didn't tell Gary.</p><p>"Alright buddy," Gary said as he picked up Ash who hissed and clawed, even bit, opening  a few scratches on Garys arms as he carried Ash away, Meowth following only to have a door be slammed in his face.</p><p>"What the fuck Gary?!" Ash snapped after being put down on a table she knew was for many science related things, Gary started looking for an item.</p><p>"We should probably be making sure those kits are coming along healthy, shouldn't we Ashie?" Gary asked as he held up a tube of goo and an item that was unmistakably an ultrasound rod, Ashes eyes widened an extreme amount as she took a step back in fear.</p><p>"How did you find out?" Ash asked, Gary gave her a blank look.</p><p>"Bro, scientist, I know my shit man," Gary said before pressing down the Purugly on it's back, "now don't worry, you'll only feel the disgusting sensation until it's over."</p><p>Gary was correct, that was a gross sensation. Ooze mixing into her fur, it was warm and slimy, the room was dark. On a small screen there was a group of four incomplete blob like forms, they moved slightly. Ash was panicking only a little bit until Gary pulled away the device and grabbed a towel, wiping down Ashes form gently.</p><p>"Two things, no deformities among other apparent defects in their growth and how come you didn't tell me?" Gary asked as he let down Ash who skittered off to the door, she couldn't reach the handle.</p><p>"Because I didn't want you to worry about me, you care about me to much Gary," Ash snapped, Gary felt a little bit hurt at the statement but released Ash from his room anyways.</p><p>Ash was quick to skitter off, she needed out, out of this stupid form and out of this damn pregnancy. She was still stuck inside the household though and couldn't get out. Just like she said, Gary was quick to make a comment on Ashes health.</p><p>"Come on Ashie, you should be resting in this state," Gary said, Ash snapped to stare at him.</p><p>"No way, I'm finding a way to change back right now, cause it's become clear none of you are," Ash snapped, Meowth was still perched on the counter and ready to add something.</p><p>"Ash go back to your basket right now," Meowth said a little bit harshly, staring down Ash.</p><p>"Fine, but as soon as these kits are born I'm finding a cure," Ash said before sauntering off to her basket under the TV.</p><p>"Meowth, that was harsh man," Gary said, glaring at Meowth, Meowth shrugged his shoulders nonchalantly.</p><p>"Naw man, sometimes you gotta put your paw down," Meowth explained with ease, "plus Ash <em>is</em> carrying my only litter, can't have her harming the next generation."</p>

  <p>Pakless.</p><p>He didn't expect it to go so horribly, terribly wrong.</p><p>For starters, he should be dead right now, having been pakless for nearly a month at this point. And secondly, he can feel the entire spectrum of Irken emotion, and his human area is seeping into his personality on an extreme level. The third thing being that he can reproduce biologically even though Irkens have moved on from that low, animal point in evolution millions, if not billions, of years ago, even before the Pak; said Pak simply helping keep it in check.</p><p>But, here he is, his innards constantly shifting to make room for something that he isn't aware and scraping the database for anything he can find on Irken reproduction. Every single search inquiry comes up blank leaving him completely clueless on how to make it stop, and he knows its coming, what it specifically is and he's afraid. He doesn't know why he's afraid though, he's never experienced fear until now and he really doe not like it in the slightest. He'll just have to record it, everything he learns that is, and try and get it back into Irken databases if anyone else is too experience it- their Pak breaking and them not dying, that is.</p><p>Dib hasn't even bothered him, normally he doesn't count the minutes, but losing control of his impossibly muted emotions has thrown him into the swing of trying to ignore all of them. Fear, joy, anger, sadness, to name a few, he doesn't even want to touch the complicated ones that the throw the baseline ones into a blender and mix up his grasp on reality. So instead he tries his hardest to focus on the clocks ticking and GIRs antics, and because of that, he's realized how desperate he is for interaction given quarantining himself off from humanity as a whole.</p><p>No school, no walks, absolutely nothing but him and his now rampant thoughts he was sure he knew so well. Turns out he doesn't though, because all he can think about is how this will affect him, not the mission- no, his objectives and cares for the fruitless conquest flew out the window the second his Pak came off. He can just sit in his house and wait patiently for it to end, whatever it even is, he doesn't know how to fix it because he lost a piece of his Pak so he's placing all his hope into it just going away.</p><p>---</p><p>Dib knocked on Zims door, normally he would be bashing in Zims door and throwing accusations, but in past years, he's come to the conclusion nothing bad will happen that he can't stop if its relating to Zim. The alien still went to school everyday, still plotted and schemed on schedule, but aside from that, they had an understanding, an unspoken agreement that Dib was sure of. They both didn't fit in and were cast out of their family, or the closest thing to it, and surrounded by idiots who can't see past the end of their own nose. And something about the notion that somewhere out there, even in the depths of space, someone who gets it exists is really comforting and the only reason why Dib cares that Zim has been missing for a month.</p><p>He never expected himself, aged, aged, he honestly can't recall, he just knows time has passed, to be standing patiently at Zims doorstep waiting for the green alien to step out and exist. He'll be happy if Zim even has an alien ray pressed to his head, just to know the only who gets it is alive will be more than enough for Dib. And he hears a shout of 'GIR!' followed by clumsy footsteps before the little robot, fully disguised, cracks open the door and stares up at Dib expectantly.</p><p>"Hi GIR, wheres Zim?" Dib asked, instead of getting a response, GIR zooms off and Dib makes his way inside, still unsure of how to get that robot in line after so long.</p><p>He walks further into the house, unaware of what be-spectacle he's even looking at- and becoming a part of for that matter.</p><p>Walls covered in thick and oozing webbing, its gelatinous and he's afraid to touch if its sticky or if its alive, what if its hungry? He shudders at the thought as he steps deeper. Everything is dark, not dark as in he can't see, but dark as in he's the only thing illuminated with the outside world; the entire building is stagnant and everything feels wrong. It's thrumming with life but not the pulse of electricity that he's used to, it's organic and alive in a way he can't begin to explain even as a blocked off doorway opens when he steps closer- green bio-luminescence welcoming.</p><p>And he swears he's been in this room, he's seen it a hundred times over he knows he has, but he hasn't, its new and he doesn't like that idea. The idea that something he holds so dearly, something he knows isn't like this, well, its like this now, its changed and he's had no say in the matter, he didn't even know it was happening. Still, he presses on, he needs one thing to show him that Zim is alive, fresh food, running water, something falling- he knows he heard Zims voice and that is proof enough he's alive, his stupid brain won't let him believe he's alive despite that.</p><p>He keeps walking, he keeps stepping between living passages, watching as the webbing gets thicker and the rooms get smaller around him, like he's getting larger. Up and down don't exist anymore, he can't be sure if the house is moving, he can't be sure which way stairs go and his sense of direction doesn't work because everything is truly dark now. The light streaming in from the open door faded a long time ago and now all that's left is the distant memory and how he struggles to recall it within the humid grips of the void.</p><p>His footsteps are loud, echoing in a place far too small to sustain an echo and it makes him disoriented. His hands are pressed to the wall purely to push himself forward even though it tries to push him out and away from whatever lies dormant at the end of this seemingly eternal maze. He knows its Zim, he knows that it being Zim whose waiting at the end of the hall is the only logical option, but he also knows that anything Irken draws in things that aren't logical. Still he pushes forward, even as his breathing becomes further and further apart as the caverns grow slimmer until finally, they give.</p><p>They spread entirely, slowly and he collapses as oxygen is dragged into his form, eyes shut even as he listens to the thrum of the webbing, aware its receding away from him even though its still dark in the caverns. He sits up, his form is shaky, there isn't enough oxygen in here for him to last more than a day, that he's entirely sure of; he reaches for his backpack, please, please, please let it be that Gaz didn't take his extra oxygen. He finds it, but doesn't pull it out, instead he stands up and walks further down hallways, now the ooze is too far away for him to touch or hold onto for support- it still threatens to ooze onto him from above.</p><p>And at the end of it all is a doorway, and inside that doorway is a cocoon, made of the same webbing and pulsating because it is alive and Dib wants to know more. He walks up to it, reaches out, but retracts his hand because what if Zim doesn't understand spoken English anymore? He heads over to the whiteboard first and writes a big 'OK' with a smiley face, because whatever is about to happen when he touches that cocoon, he is very okay with it. He needs to know more, years ago he would blast it to bits, but now, he just wants to learn more about his Irken companion. So he returns to the casing, pressing his hand to it, he's doing this for science, no matter what ends up being the sacrifice, its for science- body or brain, he needs to know.</p><p>A clawed hand pressed itself to his and he steps back, trying to stay calm as the cocoon cracks open, the same Zim reemerges, Pakless and larger; what appears to be a biological set of spider legs are sprouted from his back like the ones of his pack. His eyes are the same deep red and Dib can see his reflection in them as he's towered over by the Irken, metamorphosis completed entirely, one no Irken has underwent since the beginning of the Pak. Dib looks so small under Zim and to say it makes him feel small would be a gross understatement- it makes him feel dominated if anything. His face is burning a bright red as a prehensile tongue flickers out to lick him, leaving a warm stripe on his neck and Dib shuddered because it felt so good and wrong all at once. A moan slipped from his lips and he went to raise his hands, Zims extra appendages shot from his back and kept Dibs hands from covering his mouth.</p><p>"Zim? Zim are you in there?" Dib asked, watching as a form of recollection flashed in Zims eyes, he only pressed down further, his alien grin stretching further, he cracked open his mouth to speak allowing Dib to see row after row of sharpened fangs that thinned out bet kept going down his throat.</p><p>"Ḍ̵͐͋i̶̖̰̔b̶̝̋," the word came out in a hiss and Dib himself didn't understand it, Irken in nature, "h̵u̵m̸a̷n̴," another hiss, a bit clearer, "mission, the mission," a series of hisses and snarls that were clearly intended to be English, "I failed."</p><p>"They exiled you, idiot," Dib said boldly, Zim doubled down, dragging a few fangs across Zims throat allowing the human to shudder as a claw reached and tore open the front of his shirt, scars from previous fights.</p><p>"I know," Zim snarled back, this wasn't the Zim Dib knew, this was a different Zim, a feral Zim, one running on instinct alone because his Pak isn't there to regulate his emotions and its scary and arousing all at once, "because, of that the least I can do for Irk, is reproduce."</p><p>"How you gonna do that huh? No Irkens to mate with," Dib said, smirking as he did so, somehow his inner twelve year old was being dragged out in a situation like this just to poke fun at Zims situation.</p><p>"You're terribly mistaken Dib, we Irkens produce on a different level than you inferior humans do," Zim explained, letting his tongue flick over Dibs neck again.</p><p>"Oh yeah? How so, Zim?" Dib asked, smirking again.</p><p>"You've heard of the term 'oviposition' haven't you Dib?" Zim asked, the way Dib didn't response and the way his eyes darted away told the Irken a lot, it only made sense he would study seemingly perverse aspects of alien biology.</p><p>Dib gives a prompt nod, "yeah, obviously," he sounds nervous, and his tense is visible when Zim retracts all but two of his fangs.</p><p>"Good, this may sting lightly, Dib-mate," Zim hissed out before clamping down on Dibs neck, eliciting a scream from the human, although it faded rather fast as aphrodisiacs shot into his blood stream, it made him feel woozy, if he remembered it he would write it down tomorrow.</p><p>But he's not quite sure that he will remember, it feels like its draining his conscious a little bit, he'll have to hack Zims security cams again to get an idea of what happened. Instead he focuses on trying to keep his grasp on whats really happening, staring as the magenta plates melded into Zims body shift apart revealing what could only be described as a godless schlong. Tentacle, prehensile, twitchy, ridged, it looked like hell, but, Dib couldn't do much to fight against it with his speech slurred and four sharpened appendages holding him down- a seemingly clawed hand goes to his pants. He feels the fabric tear and split down the sides as Zim undoes every stitch with a lot more care and finesse than expected, then he tries to line himself up.</p><p>Dib tenses and writhes, he knows no one else has underwent this, that no one else could record this scientific discovery, oh god, the things he'll do for science. He eases up and accepts it, the ridges don't hurt as much as he though they would've, and the tentacle nestles inside of his ass almost comfortably, aside from the fact its cold. He shudders and downright moans when it starts to move, scouring his insides, coating them in some sort of liquid, as nasty as this is, its a lot more pleasurable than he'll admit to. Sure, he's been a bit deprived lately all things considered, but having a tentacle up his ass? It's doing things to him he's not exactly proud of, but that won't stop him from embracing it, bucking his hips a little bit, smirk barely existing.</p><p>Then Zim starts to move himself, coils shifting until Dib is aware of the bulge at the base of the tentacle, he can feel it pressing against his rim. That causes some panic, but given Dibs current state of being painfully pinned to the cold floor of Zims lab, he can't exactly do much to stop it from happening. He just trains his focus on the churrs rumbling from Zims somewhere, he can't pinpoint the exact location whilst being pinned down and railed, but his mind keeps getting pulled away from everything even distantly scientific to the ridges rubbing across his insides. It's a sensation, it catches his attention, and the weak shriek he releases when the lump pushes through causes Zim to cease momentarily before it continues down. Dib tries to focus on it, size, texture, anything he can recall for later, but he can't really do that when a second pops in, and a third.</p><p>He doesn't even want to know how many are left, he bares his neck to Zim once more, hoping the entranced Irken gets the message to do it again. Somehow it works, Dib doesn't know how, but Zim bites down once more, injecting more of that aphrodisiac, this time it forces Dib to the verge of just passing out. Every sensation is enhanced now, but he's so tired, everything is blurring together and crashing into each other and whatever sounds he can produce he does until he's falling asleep. Floating in the sky and pulled into the depths, he's never passed out to drugs before, but, at the same time he can't be sure if this really counts as a drug.</p><p>---</p><p>Dib shoots awake in his room, panting, scared a little bit as well, what a dream, a terrible, sexy, dream at that (he wants it to be real). He sits up and makes his way to put on fresh clothing, he feels tight, but when he runs a hand along his torso he feels nothing. He slides on his coat and makes his way down the stairs, they feel a bit sticky under his boots, but he pays no mind. He takes a seat at the kitchen table across from Gaz, theirs a piece of toast no one has claimed so he grabs it- Gaz glances up from her gaming system and her eyes widen.</p><p>"Where did that killer bite come from?" Gaz asked, Dib raised a brow as he brought a hand to his neck, feeling for marks, he recoiled a bit when his fingers brushed over them.</p><p>"Oh no," was all Dib could muster muttering as he pushes away from the table before running up stairs to the bathroom.</p><p>X-ray, X-ray, he knows the modded miniature is here somewhere, but he can't find it, and everything he touches is a little bit sticky. When he does find it, it isn't where he left it, instead it sits in the towel closet, its covered in claw marks and there is one picture that hasn't been deleted. He's hesitant to open it, but he does, and he feels his stomach turn at the sight as he inspects it.</p><p>It's him, his torso at least, his blood is off color and he sees that his rectum was burst and restitched- very, very close to where the tear in the organ lays is a cluster of about five orbs and he knows exactly what they are. Eggs, he has a cluster of eggs resting along the side of his large intestine, how are those going to get out of him? How much larger are they going to get? Panic shoots through him, but, before he opts to do much of anything else, he takes another picture and he isn't pleased with what he sees. The eggs are larger, not by a whole lot, but he places his hand to where they rest and presses down, he can feel them, he wants to vomit.</p><p>Dib heads to his room instead, grabs his laptop and starts on the short process of hacking into Zims security cams, he'll figure out everything that happened even if it kills him. He'll record it in a book because who knows how long Irkens live, who knows whether or not Zim will ever go back to normal, maybe he'll just become a broodmaster and turn humanity to incubators. If Dib can record his experiences and find a way out of this fate, then he'd be saving humanity if Zim goes that far, otherwise, it'd make a neat read on Mysterious Mysteries if anything.</p><p>Gaz walks up to his room, she doesn't bother knocking, letting herself in instead. She grabs the X-ray Dib had brought with him and glances over the pictures, she makes sounds of disgust.</p><p>"What's with the pictures?" She asked sharply.</p><p>"Those are my innards, I'm working on figuring out how to prevent those," he gestured to the orbs, "from hatching and tearing me open inside out."</p><p>"Nasty, where did they come from?" Gaz asked, zooming in the photo, trying to get the detail, search for cracks.</p><p>"Zim," Dib answered bluntly, tapping the eraser end of his pencil against his desk absently, Gaz stayed silent, unable to form much of a response.</p><p>"You're joking," she said, her tone deadpan, Dib shook his head.</p><p>"My life would be a lot easier if I was," Dib said, there was a hint of a sigh as he spoke.</p>
